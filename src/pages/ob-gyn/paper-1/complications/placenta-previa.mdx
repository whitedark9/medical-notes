# Placenta Previa

<details>
<summary>Antepartum Haemorrhage</summary>

> Bleeding from the genital tract after 24 weeks of gestation and before the birth of the baby (i.e., before the second stage of labour).

### Causes of APH

1. Major causes:
   - Placenta previa
   - Placental abruption (abruptio placentae)
1. Other causes:
   - Vasa previa
   - Local causes (e.g., cervical polyp, cervical carcinoma, cervical ectropion)
   - Unexplained (idiopathic)

</details>

> A condition in which the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment **partially or completely covering the internal os**.

## Causes / Risk Factors

- Previous **placenta previa**
- Previous **Caesarean section**
- **Uterine surgery** or instrumentation (e.g., D\&C, myomectomy)
- **Assisted reproductive techniques** (e.g., IVF)
- **Multiparity**
- **Multiple pregnancy**
- **Advanced maternal age**
- **Smoking**

## Grading / Classification

According to **degree of placental encroachment on internal os**:

1. **Grade I / Minor:**

   - **Placenta lies in lower segment but not reaching the os**

2. **Grade II:**

   - **Placenta reaches internal os but does not cover it**

3. **Grade III:**

   - **Placenta partially covers internal os**

4. **Grade IV / Major:**

   - **Placenta completely covers internal os (central placenta previa)**

## Diagnosis of Placenta Previa

### 1. History:

- **Painless, recurrent, bright red vaginal bleeding** after 24 weeks
- May occur **without warning**
- No signs of labour
- May be associated with malpresentation (e.g., breech, transverse)

### 2. Physical Examination:

1. Abdominal Examination:
   - Uterus: **Soft, non-tender**
   - Lie: May be **oblique/transverse**
   - Presentation: Often **abnormal**
   - Fetal parts may be easily palpable
   - Fetal heart sounds usually **present and normal**
1. Speculum Examination:
   - To exclude **local cervical causes**
   - Done **only in hospital** with facilities for emergency delivery
1. Digital Vaginal Examination:
   - ~~Contraindicated~~ unless placenta previa is ruled out
   - Risk of causing **massive haemorrhage**

### 3. Investigations:

#### a. For Diagnosis:

- **Transvaginal ultrasound** (TVS) – **Gold standard**

  - More accurate than transabdominal scan
  - Determines **site of placental implantation and relationship to internal os**

#### b. For Causes:

- Obstetric history (prior CS, surgeries)
- Review of previous ultrasound findings

#### c. For Complications:

- **Full blood count** → Check for anemia
- **Group & crossmatch** → Prepare for potential transfusion
- **Coagulation profile** → In case of major bleed
- **CTG (Cardiotocography)** → Fetal well-being
- **Kleihauer-Betke test** (if Rh negative) → Quantify fetomaternal haemorrhage

## Management

### General Principles

- Admit if **symptomatic** or significant previa (Grade II–IV)
- **Avoid vaginal examination** unless placenta previa is excluded
- Mode and timing of delivery depends on **grade, gestational age, fetal well-being**, and **maternal stability**

### Emergency Management (If Bleeding is Active)

1. Airway: Ensure airway is patent.
2. Breathing: Administer O₂ 10–15 L/min via mask.
3. Circulation:

   - Insert 2 large-bore IV lines.
   - Start crystalloid resuscitation.
   - Crossmatch 4–6 units blood.
   - Transfuse as needed.

4. Disability: Check consciousness (shock index).
5. Exposure: Undress to assess ongoing bleeding.
6. Fetal assessment: Continuous CTG or urgent ultrasound.

   - Prepare for emergency LSCS if unstable.

### Pre-conception:

- Counsel woman with previous placenta previa:

  - Avoid modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, repeated D\&C).
  - Early antenatal care in future pregnancies.
  - Consider low anterior uterine scar as a risk in future pregnancies.

### Antenatal Management

#### 1. General Principles:

- Hospitalize if symptomatic.
- Avoid vaginal examinations.
- Administer Rh immunoglobulin if mother is Rh–ve and bleeding.
- Iron supplementation if anemic.

#### 2. Based on Grade (Ten Teachers OG):

| Type                                   | Management Summary                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Minor (Type I & II anterior)**       | Trial of vaginal delivery possible |
| **Major (Type II posterior, III, IV)** | **Elective C-section required**    |

### Graded Management Plan

#### Grade I & II Anterior (Minor):

- **Expectant management** if no bleeding.
- **Mode of delivery:**

  - Vaginal delivery if no APH and fetal head compresses placental edge.

- **Indications for CS:**

  - Recurrent bleeding, non-reassuring CTG, or labor before term with unstable placenta.

#### Grade II Posterior, III & IV (Major):

- **Admission to hospital** if bleeding or near term.
- **Antenatal steroids** (`betamethasone 12 mg IM, 2 doses 24 hrs apart`) if \<34 weeks.
- **Elective LSCS at 37–38 weeks.**

  - Emergency LSCS if bleeding is heavy or labor starts.
  - Prepare for **PPH**: blood products, uterotonics, surgical backup.

### Intrapartum Management

#### 1st Stage (Place, Time, Mode):

- **Place**: Tertiary hospital with blood bank & neonatal ICU.
- **Time**: Elective LSCS at 37–38 weeks if stable.
- **Mode**:

  - **LSCS** for all major placenta previa and minor with complications.

#### 2nd Stage:

- If vaginal delivery allowed (Grade I/II anterior):

  - Continuous fetal monitoring.
  - Prepare for PPH.

#### 3rd Stage:

- Active management of 3rd stage of labor:

  - `IV oxytocin 10 IU bolus` + `20 IU in 1L fluid over 2–4 hrs`.
  - Monitor for **PPH**.

### Postpartum Management

#### Maternal:

- Monitor for:

  - PPH
  - Anemia
  - Infection

- Uterotonics if atonic uterus (e.g., `oxytocin`, `ergometrine`, `misoprostol`).
- Antibiotics if infected.
- Transfuse if necessary.

#### Neonatal:

- Monitor for:

  - Prematurity
  - Anemia (if fetal-maternal hemorrhage)
  - Respiratory distress syndrome

### Contraception After Placenta Previa

#### Preferred Options:

1. **Progesterone-only methods** (after 6 weeks postpartum)

   - **POP** (e.g., `desogestrel` 75 mcg daily)
   - **Implant (e.g., `Implanon`)** – 3 years
   - **Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)** – 150 mg IM every 3 months

2. **Intrauterine Device (IUD)**:

   - **CuT380A or LNG-IUS** (insert after 6 weeks postpartum if no bleeding)
   - Caution: insert only after uterine involution and **exclude infection**

3. **Permanent methods**:

   - **Tubal ligation** (if family is complete)
   - Can be done **during LSCS** if consented

#### Avoid:

- **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)** in early postpartum → ↑ risk of thromboembolism
- Avoid if woman has **anemia or ongoing bleeding**

#### Best Choice & Why?

- **DMPA or Implanon**
  → Safe, effective, **no risk of uterine perforation**, convenient
- **If family complete**: Tubal ligation during LSCS
- **IUD**: Good if low infection risk, after uterus returns to normal
