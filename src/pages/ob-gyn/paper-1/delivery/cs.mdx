# Caesarean Section (CS)

> **Delivery of the fetus, placenta and membranes through an incision in the abdominal wall (laparotomy) and the uterine wall (hysterotomy) after the period of viability.**

## Types of Caesarean Section (In Relation to Time of Operation)

1. **Elective (Planned CS)**

   - Performed **before onset of labour**, usually after 39 weeks.
   - Indications: placenta praevia, previous classical CS, contracted pelvis, some fetal malpresentations.

2. **Emergency CS**

   - Performed **after onset of labour** when urgent maternal/fetal indication arises.
   - Indications: fetal distress, obstructed labour, antepartum haemorrhage, failed induction.

3. **Crash CS** (Perimortem or Category 1 CS)

   - Performed **within minutes** for immediate life-threatening situations (e.g. cord prolapse with fetal bradycardia, severe placental abruption, maternal collapse).

## Advantages of Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS)

- Technically easier (thinner lower segment).
- Less blood loss than classical incision.
- Better healing and stronger scar → lower risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancies.
- Less postoperative morbidity (e.g. fever, infection).
- Lower incidence of adhesions compared to classical incision.
- Easier repair and shorter operative time.
- Can allow for trial of vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) in future pregnancies.

## Complications

### Intraoperative (Maternal)

- **Hemorrhage** → uterine incision, extension, vessel injury.
- **Injury to adjacent organs** → bladder, ureter, bowel.
- **Anesthetic complications** → aspiration, hypotension, allergic reactions.
- **Amniotic fluid embolism** (rare).

### Postoperative (Maternal)

- **Early**:

  - Hemorrhage (reactionary, secondary PPH).
  - Infection (wound infection, endometritis, peritonitis).
  - Thromboembolism (DVT, pulmonary embolism).
  - Urinary tract infection, retention, fistula formation.

- **Late**:

  - Adhesions → subfertility, chronic pelvic pain, intestinal obstruction.
  - Incisional hernia.
  - Scar weakness/rupture in subsequent pregnancies.
  - Placenta accreta spectrum in future pregnancies.

### Fetal Complications

- Respiratory morbidity (transient tachypnoea, RDS) – especially if done before 39 weeks.
- Iatrogenic prematurity (wrong dates, elective before lung maturity).
- Injury during operation (skin laceration, skull fracture if difficult extraction).
- Impaired adaptation to labour if elective (no hormonal surge).

## Prevention of Complications

- **Preoperative**:

  - Careful case selection & correct indication.
  - Prophylactic antibiotics (single dose before skin incision).
  - Thromboprophylaxis in high-risk mothers.
  - Antacid prophylaxis before anesthesia.

- **Intraoperative**:

  - Gentle surgical technique to avoid bladder/bowel injury.
  - Adequate hemostasis.
  - Use of transverse lower segment incision if possible.

- **Postoperative**:

  - Early ambulation to prevent DVT.
  - Good wound care and asepsis.
  - Pain control to allow mobility.
  - Monitor lochia, vitals, urine output.
  - Counseling for contraception & VBAC risks in future pregnancy.
