# Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

> xIUDs are **long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC)** devices inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy.

## Types

### 1. Non-Hormonal (Copper IUDs)

- Examples: `Cu-T 380A`, `Cu-T 375`, `Multiload Cu375`
- Effective for **5–10 years**

### 2. Hormonal (Levonorgestrel-Releasing IUDs)

- Examples: `Mirena` (LNG-52), `Kyleena` (LNG-19)
- Releases `levonorgestrel` 20 mcg/day
- Effective for **5–7 years**

## Mechanism of Action

### Copper IUD

- Copper → toxic to sperm → inhibits fertilization
- Inflammatory reaction in endometrium → prevents implantation

### Hormonal IUD (LNG-IUS)

- Thickens cervical mucus → blocks sperm entry
- Thins endometrium → prevents implantation
- Inhibits ovulation (partially)

## Indications

- **Contraception**
- **Menorrhagia** (LNG-IUS)
- **Endometriosis / Adenomyosis pain relief**
- **Endometrial protection** during HRT
- **Emergency contraception** (Copper IUD within 5 days)
- Long-term spacing or no desire for future pregnancy

## Contraindications

### Absolute

- Current PID or **STI**
- **Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding**
- **Pregnancy**
- **Uterine anomaly** (e.g., bicornuate uterus, fibroid cavity distortion)
- **Endometrial or cervical cancer**
- **Wilson's disease** (Copper IUD only)

### Relative

- Nulliparity (higher risk of expulsion)
- History of ectopic pregnancy
- Severe dysmenorrhea (Copper IUD may worsen it)

## Advantages

| Hormone-free                            | Reduces menstrual bleeding      |
| Effective immediately                   | Good for endometrial protection |
| Can be used as emergency contraception  | Improves dysmenorrhea           |
| Fertility returns quickly after removal | Fewer systemic side effects     |

## Follow-Up

1. **1st follow-up**: 4–6 weeks post-insertion

   - Check threads
   - Assess for signs of infection, expulsion

2. **Then annually**:

   - Assess thread presence
   - Monitor bleeding patterns

3. **Counsel to return if**:

   - Threads not felt
   - Pain, fever, or abnormal discharge
   - Missed periods (check for pregnancy)
