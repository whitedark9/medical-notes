# Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)

> Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is a **precancerous change** in the squamous epithelium of the cervix characterized by disordered cell maturation and increased proliferation of basal cells.

- It is **graded based on the depth of epithelial involvement** without breaching the basement membrane.

### Grades of CIN

1. **CIN 1 (Mild dysplasia)**

   - Lower 1/3 of epithelium involved
   - Often associated with transient HPV infection

2. **CIN 2 (Moderate dysplasia)**

   - Lower 2/3 of epithelium involved
   - Associated with persistent high-risk HPV

3. **CIN 3 (Severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ)**

   - More than 2/3 to full thickness involved
   - High risk of progression to invasive carcinoma if untreated

## Screening Methods to Prevent Cervical Cancer

### Primary prevention

- **HPV vaccination** (types 16, 18, and others)

  - Given before onset of sexual activity (age 9–14 years optimal)

### Secondary prevention (Cervical screening)

- Detects CIN before it progresses to carcinoma

#### Methods

1. **Pap smear (cytology)**
2. **HPV DNA testing**
3. **Liquid-based cytology (LBC)**
4. **Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA)** – for low-resource settings
5. **Co-testing** – Pap + HPV testing (higher sensitivity)

## Defined Age Groups for Screening

- **Start at age 25 years** (or within 3 years of sexual debut)
- **25–49 years**: every **3 years**
- **50–64 years**: every **5 years**
- **≥65 years**: stop screening if last 3 tests were normal

_Note: Immunocompromised women (e.g. HIV+) should be screened more frequently_

## How to Take a Pap Smear

1. Position woman in **lithotomy** position
2. Insert **Cusco's speculum** gently into the vagina
3. Visualize cervix and remove mucus with a swab
4. Use an **Ayre’s spatula** or **cytobrush**

   - Rotate 360° around the **transformation zone**

5. Spread the sample evenly on a glass slide (conventional smear)

   - OR suspend into preservative fluid (LBC)

6. Fix immediately and label properly
7. Send to cytopathology with clinical details

## Grading of Abnormal Pap Smear

(According to **Bethesda System**)

1. **Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy** (NILM)
2. **ASC-US**: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
3. **ASC-H**: Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL
4. **LSIL**: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 1)
5. **HSIL**: High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2/3)
6. **AGC**: Atypical glandular cells
7. **Squamous cell carcinoma / Adenocarcinoma**

## What is Colposcopy?

> **Colposcopy** is a **magnified visual examination** of the cervix using a **colposcope**, allowing direct visualization of abnormal areas after applying acetic acid or Lugol’s iodine.

### Used for:

- Evaluating abnormal Pap smear results
- Guiding **biopsy** from suspicious areas
- Diagnosing CIN or invasive cancer

### Acetic acid test:

- Areas with **dense aceto-white changes** suggest CIN II/III

### Iodine test:

- **Non-glycogenated epithelium** (CIN) appears **mustard yellow**

## Management

### CIN 1 (Mild Dysplasia)

- **Natural history:**
  - \~60% regress spontaneously
  - 30% persist
  - \<1% progress to invasive cancer.
- **Management:**

  1. **Observation preferred**

     - Especially in young women \<25 years, pregnancy, or immunocompetent patients

     - Repeat cytology and/or HPV DNA testing at **12 months**.
     - If both normal → return to routine screening.
     - If persistent ≥2 years or progression → treat as CIN 2/3.

  2. **Treatment if**:

     - Persistent >2 years, high-grade changes appear, patient preference.
     - Methods:

       - Excisional (LEEP, cold knife conization)
       - Ablative (cryotherapy, laser ablation) methods

### CIN 2 (Moderate Dysplasia)

- **Natural history:**

  - \~40% regress
  - 20% progress to CIN 3
  - 5% to invasive cancer

- **Management:**

  1. **Non-pregnant ≥25 years:**

     - **Excisional treatment** preferred (LEEP, cold knife conization).
     - Ablation acceptable if entire lesion visible and endocervical curettage negative.

  2. **\<25 years or pregnancy:**

     - Observation with colposcopy and cytology/HPV every 6 months.
     - Treat if persistent ≥24 months or progression to CIN 3.

### 3. **CIN 3 (Severe Dysplasia / Carcinoma in situ)**

- **Natural history:** High risk for invasive carcinoma (≥12–36%).
- **Management:**

  1. **Excisional procedure mandatory**

     - LEEP, cold knife conization (preferred if endocervical involvement suspected).

  2. **Hysterectomy** if:

     - Recurrent CIN 3, positive margins after excision, or patient completed childbearing and desires definitive treatment.

  3. **Pregnancy:**

     - Defer treatment until postpartum unless invasive cancer suspected.

### Follow-Up After Treatment (CIN 2 or CIN 3)

- HPV DNA test + cytology at 12 and 24 months.
- If both negative → return to routine 3-yearly screening.
- If abnormal → colposcopy.
