# Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)

## Definition

→ Bacterial vaginosis is a **polymicrobial imbalance** of the vaginal flora, characterized by:

- **Loss of normal lactobacilli**
- **Overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria** (e.g., _Gardnerella vaginalis_, _Mobiluncus_, _Prevotella_)
- Not a true STI but **associated with sexual activity**

## Causes / Risk Factors

| Cause / Risk Factor             | Explanation                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Sexual activity**             | Especially new/multiple partners         |
| **Vaginal douching**            | Disrupts vaginal flora                   |
| **Antibiotics use**             | Reduces lactobacilli                     |
| **Smoking**                     | Associated with altered flora            |
| **Intrauterine devices (IUDs)** | Increase risk slightly                   |
| **Lack of estrogen**            | Postmenopausal women – less lactobacilli |

## Clinical Features

### A. Symptoms

| Feature                        | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abnormal vaginal discharge** | Thin, **greyish-white**, **homogeneous**, may be **profuse**  |
| **Fishy odor**                 | Especially **after intercourse** (due to alkalinity of semen) |
| **No pruritus or pain**        | Unlike candidiasis or trichomoniasis                          |
| **May be asymptomatic**        | In up to 50% of cases                                         |

### B. Signs (on Speculum Exam)

| Sign                              | Finding                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Discharge**                     | Thin, adherent to vaginal walls, grey-white |
| **No vulvitis or vaginitis**      | No erythema or edema                        |
| **No cervical motion tenderness** | Unless associated PID                       |

## Investigations

### A. Diagnostic Criteria (Amsel's Criteria – 3 out of 4 required)

> `AMSEL` - `A`lkali, `M`icrosopy, `S`melly test, `E`xcretion

| Amsel’s Criteria                          | Positive Finding                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Vaginal pH > 4.5                       | (Normal vaginal pH = 3.5–4.5)                  |
| 2. Homogeneous, thin grey-white discharge | Adherent to vaginal walls                      |
| 3. Positive **whiff test**                | Fishy odor after adding 10% KOH                |
| 4. **Clue cells** on microscopy           | Vaginal epithelial cells covered with bacteria |

### B. Alternative Test

- **Gram stain** (Nugent score): gold standard in research
- **NAAT/PCR** for _Gardnerella_ – rarely needed in routine practice

## Complications

- Preterm labor
- Premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)
- Late miscarriage
- Postpartum endometritis
- ↑ risk of PID (esp. post-procedures like IUD insertion, curettage)
- Post-abortal sepsis
- ↑ risk of acquiring HIV/STIs
- Recurrent BV: Common (30–50% recurrence rate)

# Management of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)

## 1. General Principles

- **Treat symptomatic women**
- **Treat asymptomatic women** only if:

  - Pregnant and high risk for preterm birth
  - Undergoing **gynaecological procedures** (e.g. IUD insertion, surgical abortion, hysteroscopy)

- Sexual partners **do not need treatment** (BV is not an STI)

## 2. First-Line Antibiotic Treatment (Non-pregnant women)

- `Metronidazole` 400–500 mg `orally` twice daily for 7 days
  → Most effective and widely used
  → Avoid alcohol during and 48 hrs after (disulfiram-like reaction)

- Alternative:

  - `Metronidazole` 2 g `orally` single dose (higher relapse rate)
  - `Clindamycin` 300 mg `orally` twice daily for 7 days
  - `Clindamycin` 2% `vaginal` cream, once daily at bedtime for 7 days
  - `Metronidazole` 0.75% `vaginal` gel, once daily for 5 days

## 3. Treatment in Pregnancy

- `Metronidazole` 400 mg BD for 5–7 days (safe in all trimesters)
- **Avoid topical clindamycin in late pregnancy** due to risk of neonatal complications
- **No need to treat asymptomatic pregnant women** unless high-risk or undergoing procedures

## 4. Recurrent BV Management

- Defined as **≥3 episodes in 12 months**

Options include:

- **Repeat course** of `metronidazole` (oral or vaginal)
- `Metronidazole` gel 0.75% twice weekly for 4–6 months (maintenance)
- `Probiotics` (e.g. lactobacillus vaginal suppositories): limited evidence but may reduce recurrence
- Lifestyle advice:

  - Avoid vaginal douching
  - Use condoms
  - Avoid frequent partner change

## 5. Surgical Consideration

- Only indicated in **complicated BV with abscess or associated PID**, which is rare
- In post-procedural PID from BV flora, consider **hospital admission and IV antibiotics**

## 6. Follow-Up

- Not routinely required if symptoms resolve
- Consider test of cure:

  - In pregnancy
  - Recurrent or persistent symptoms

- Advise return if:

  - Discharge persists
  - Symptoms worsen
  - New sexual exposure occurs

## 7. Patient Advice & Education

- Avoid vaginal irritants (douching, harsh soaps)
- Condom use may reduce recurrence
- BV is **not sexually transmitted**, but associated with sexual activity
- Inform about risk of recurrence and when to return
- No need to treat male partner
- In female same-sex partners, consider evaluation if symptoms recur
