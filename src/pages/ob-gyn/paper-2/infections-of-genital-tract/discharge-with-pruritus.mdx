# Vaginal Itching and Discharge

## Differential Diagnosis

1. **Vulvovaginal candidiasis (Candida albicans infection)**
2. **Trichomonas vaginalis infection (Trichomoniasis)**

_(Other important differential: Bacterial vaginosis, but for this case, Candida and Trichomonas are the two most likely)_

## Differentiation Between the Two

| Feature                | Vulvovaginal Candidiasis                                   | Trichomonas Vaginitis                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discharge**          | Thick, white, curdy (“cottage-cheese like”), adherent      | Frothy, yellow-green, offensive, profuse                               |
| **Itching/Irritation** | Intense vulval itching & soreness                          | Mild–moderate itching, burning micturition, dyspareunia                |
| **Vaginal pH**         | Normal or acidic (≤4.5)                                    | Raised (>4.5)                                                          |
| **Examination**        | Vulva red, swollen; adherent white plaques on vaginal wall | Vaginal mucosa inflamed; “strawberry cervix” with punctate hemorrhages |
| **Microscopy**         | Wet mount/KOH → budding yeast cells & pseudohyphae         | Wet mount → motile flagellated protozoa                                |
| **Odour**              | No fishy odour                                             | Offensive smell may be present                                         |

## Treatment

### 1. General Measures (Applicable to both conditions)

- **Lifestyle advice**:

  - Wear loose, cotton underwear.
  - Avoid tight clothing, synthetic underwear, and prolonged dampness (sweating).
  - Avoid perfumed soaps, vaginal douches, and irritants.
  - Proper perineal hygiene (wipe front to back).
  - Avoid unnecessary antibiotics and steroids (predispose to Candida).

- **Sexual health**:

  - Safe sexual practices, consistent condom use.
  - Partner treatment essential for Trichomoniasis.

- **Follow-up**:

  - Review after completion of therapy if symptoms persist.
  - Recurrent infections → screen for diabetes, HIV, or immunosuppression.

### 2. Specific Treatment

#### Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

- **Topical antifungals (preferred in pregnancy):**

  - Clotrimazole 500 mg vaginal pessary single dose OR
  - Clotrimazole 100 mg vaginal pessary daily × 6 nights OR
  - Clotrimazole cream for external vulval irritation.

- **Oral antifungals (not in pregnancy):**

  - Fluconazole 150 mg orally single dose.
  - Alternative: Itraconazole 200 mg twice daily for 1 day.

- **Recurrent Candidiasis (>4/year):**

  - Fluconazole 150 mg weekly × 6 months.
  - Evaluate for underlying diabetes, immunosuppression, or antibiotic overuse.

#### Trichomonas Vaginitis

- **Metronidazole (DOC):**

  - 2 g orally as a single dose OR
  - 400 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.

- **Tinidazole 2 g orally single dose** (alternative).
- **Partner treatment mandatory** (treat both simultaneously).
- **Alcohol contraindicated** during treatment and 24 hrs after (disulfiram-like reaction).
- **Pregnancy:** Metronidazole 400 mg BD for 7 days (safe after 1st trimester).

### 3. Prevention

- Good personal hygiene.
- Control of predisposing conditions (e.g., diabetes, immunosuppression).
- Rational use of antibiotics and steroids.
- Safe sexual practices (condoms, monogamy).
- Regular screening if recurrent infections or high-risk sexual behaviour.
