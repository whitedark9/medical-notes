# Vesico-Vaginal Fistula (VVF)

> An **abnormal epithelial-lined communication between the bladder and the vagina**, resulting in continuous involuntary leakage of urine through the vagina.

## Types of VVF (Based on Location)

1. **Simple VVF**

   - Small, single fistula involving the trigone or base of bladder
   - Common in obstructed labor or after hysterectomy

2. **Complex VVF**

   - Large, multiple or recurrent fistula
   - Associated with radiation or malignancy

3. **Juxtacervical fistula**

   - Near the cervix (common post-hysterectomy)

4. **Urethro-vaginal fistula**

   - Involving the urethra and anterior vaginal wall

5. **Uretero-vaginal fistula**

   - From ureter directly into vagina (urine leaks only when bladder is empty)

6. **Vault VVF**

   - Involves the vaginal vault (after hysterectomy)

## Urinary Incontinence

> **Involuntary leakage of urine** that is objectively demonstrable and a social or hygienic problem.

### Types

> STFU MF

1. **`S`tress Incontinence**

   - Leakage during increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing, laughing)
   - Due to pelvic floor weakness or urethral hypermobility

1. **`T`rue or Total Incontinence**

   - Continuous leakage (e.g., from VVF or ectopic ureter)

1. **`F`unctional Incontinence**

   - Due to cognitive, physical, or environmental barriers to toileting (e.g., dementia, immobility)

1. **`U`rge Incontinence**

   - Sudden urge to void followed by involuntary leakage
   - Often due to detrusor overactivity (overactive bladder)

1. **`M`ixed Incontinence**

   - Combination of stress and urge incontinence

1. **Over`f`low Incontinence**

   - Constant dribbling due to bladder over-distention
   - Causes: obstructive (e.g., fibroid), neurogenic bladder

## Diagnosis of Vesico-Vaginal Fistula

### Clinical History

- Continuous painless urine leakage per vagina, unrelated to micturition
- History of:

  - Obstructed labor
  - Pelvic surgery (esp. hysterectomy)
  - Pelvic irradiation
  - Malignancy

### Physical Examination

- Visual inspection of vaginal wall with speculum
- Pool of clear fluid in vaginal vault
- Fistula opening may be seen

### Confirmatory Tests

1. **Three-swab test (Tampon test / Dye test)**

   - 3 vaginal swabs placed (upper, middle, lower)
   - Bladder filled with `methylene blue` via catheter
   - After 10–15 mins, remove swabs:

     - **Upper swab blue** → VVF
     - **Middle swab blue** → Middle vaginal wall injury
     - **Lower swab blue** → Urethral injury or dribbling
     - **Blue not seen, but swab wet** → Uretero-vaginal fistula (urine from ureter is not dyed)

2. **Cystoscopy**

   - Direct visualization of fistula tract and ureteric orifices

3. **Retrograde cystography or CT cystogram**

   - Demonstrates leakage of contrast from bladder to vagina

4. **IV Urography**

   - To evaluate ureter involvement or associated urinary tract anomaly

5. **MRI pelvis**

   - For complex/recurrent cases or preoperative planning

## Management

### Goals of Management

- Close the fistula
- Restore urinary continence
- Preserve or restore normal anatomy and function
- Prevent recurrence

### ABCDEF Initial Approach (if acute)

1. **A – Airway**: Usually unaffected
2. **B – Breathing**: Not involved
3. **C – Circulation**: Assess for anemia/dehydration (esp. in neglected obstetric fistula)
4. **D – Disability**: Assess impact on quality of life
5. **E – Exposure**: Examine genital tract, classify fistula
6. **F – Fluids & Function**: Ensure proper bladder drainage via Foley catheter

### Conservative Management

#### Indications

- **Small fistula (\<1 cm)** and diagnosed within **3 weeks of injury**
- No signs of infection or necrosis

#### Measures

- Continuous bladder drainage via **Foley catheter** for 2–4 weeks
- Treat **urinary tract infection** (e.g., with `ciprofloxacin`)
- Good perineal hygiene
- Nutritional support and anemia correction

**Success rate**: \~20–40% (better in fresh fistula)

### Surgical Management

#### Timing of Repair

- **3–6 months after injury** for obstetric VVF (when inflammation subsides)
- **After 6–12 weeks** in post-surgical fistulas (once healthy granulation tissue forms)
- Earlier in fresh, small, simple fistula with no infection

#### Surgical Approaches

##### 1. Transvaginal Approach

- Preferred for **low and simple fistulas**
- Less blood loss, quicker recovery
- Common techniques:

  - **Latzko’s partial colpocleisis**
  - **Layered fistula repair**

##### 2. Transabdominal Approach

- Used for **high, complex, recurrent** or **supratrigonal** fistulas
- Can perform bladder augmentation or ureteric reimplantation if needed

##### 3. Laparoscopic or Robotic Repair

- For selected cases, offers better precision

#### Surgical Principles

- Excision of fistula tract with **minimal tissue trauma**
- **Layered closure** of bladder and vaginal walls
- **Interposition grafts** (e.g., omentum, Martius flap) to prevent recurrence
- Tension-free repair
- Post-op **bladder drainage** via Foley catheter for 14–21 days

### Postoperative Care

- Foley catheter care, bladder irrigation
- Treat UTI if present
- Vaginal hygiene, avoid intercourse for 3–6 months
- Estrogen cream in postmenopausal women to aid healing
- Monitor for signs of leak or recurrence

### Management of Recurrent or Complex VVF

- Evaluation with cystoscopy, IVU, or MRI
- Referral to specialized **urogynecology or reconstructive surgery center**
- May require multiple surgeries, tissue grafts, or urinary diversion in end-stage cases

### Complications of VVF Repair

- Recurrence of fistula
- Bladder dysfunction (urgency, frequency)
- Stress urinary incontinence
- Dyspareunia
- Ureteral injury or obstruction
- Psychological impact

### Prevention

- Skilled obstetric care (early C-section in obstructed labor)
- Careful surgical technique during pelvic operations
- Avoid unnecessary hysterectomy
- Adequate bladder dissection and identification of ureters
