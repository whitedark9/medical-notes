# Breech Delivery

။ Breech presentation is **longitudinal lie with buttocks or lower limbs presenting** at the pelvic brim

- Incidence: \~3–4% at term
  → Spontaneous version usually occurs before 36 weeks

## Types of Breech Presentation

| Type                                      | Description                                               | Frequency         |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Frank breech**                          | Hips flexed, knees extended (legs up)                     | Most common (70%) |
| **Complete breech**                       | Hips & knees flexed (cross-legged)                        | 10%               |
| **Incomplete breech (Footling/Kneeling)** | One or both hips/knees extended → foot or knee presenting | 20%               |
| **Kneeling breech**                       | Knees presenting first (rare)                             | Rare              |

## Causes of Breech Presentation

### A. Maternal Causes

1. Uterine anomalies (e.g., bicornuate uterus, fibroids)
2. Pelvic tumors (e.g., ovarian cysts)
3. Previous breech delivery
4. Multiparity → lax uterus

### B. Fetal Causes

1. Prematurity (\<36 weeks)
2. Fetal anomalies:

   - Anencephaly
   - Hydrocephalus
   - Neuromuscular disorders

3. Multiple gestation (esp. second twin)
4. Polyhydramnios / Oligohydramnios
5. Placenta previa

## Complications of Breech Delivery

> Breech increases both **maternal and fetal morbidity/mortality**, especially in **vaginal delivery**.

### A. Fetal Complications (with pathophysiology)

| Complication                 | Mechanism (→)                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Birth asphyxia**           | Head is last to deliver → prolonged compression of cord → hypoxia                                  |
| **Cord prolapse**            | Footling/incomplete breech → poor fit in pelvis → cord slips through cervix                        |
| **Head entrapment**          | After body delivers → cervix may not be fully dilated or poorly fitting head → obstructed delivery |
| **Intracranial hemorrhage**  | Rapid decompression of head or traction → rupture of vessels                                       |
| **Fractures / dislocations** | Improper handling during assisted breech delivery → femur/humerus fracture, hip dislocation        |
| **Soft tissue trauma**       | Facial bruising, genital edema, organ trauma from manipulation                                     |
| **Death**                    | Asphyxia, trauma, prematurity, or delayed delivery of head                                         |

### B. Maternal Complications

| Complication             | Mechanism                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Genital tract trauma** | Manipulations during delivery → vaginal or cervical tears |
| **Uterine rupture**      | Overdistension or aggressive traction                     |
| **PPH**                  | Trauma, uterine atony, retained placenta                  |
| **Psychological stress** | Emergency delivery or traumatic birth                     |

## Diagnosis of Breech Presentation

### I. Clinical Diagnosis

#### A. Abdominal Examination (After 36 weeks)

1. **Fundal Grip**

   - **Head (hard, round, ballotable)** felt in fundus
   - → Suggests breech presentation

2. **Lateral Grips**

   - **Back on one side**, small parts (limbs) on the other

3. **Pelvic Grip (Pawlik’s)**

   - **Soft, irregular, broad mass** (breech) in lower pole
   - **Not easily balloted**

4. **Auscultation**

   - Fetal heart sounds best heard **above the umbilicus**

5. **Lie and Attitude**

   - Longitudinal lie, but **attitude may be extended** (e.g., frank breech)

#### B. Vaginal Examination (Only during labor or when necessary)

- **Palpable sacrum, ischial tuberosities, anus**, or **feet/knees**
- Risk of infection if membranes ruptured → usually avoided antenatally

### II. Ultrasound (Confirmatory and Most Accurate)

1. **Fetal Position**

   - Visual confirmation of **head in fundus**, **breech in pelvis**

2. **Type of Breech**

   - **Frank / Complete / Incomplete / Footling** breech can be differentiated

3. **Fetal Weight Estimation**

   - Important for planning delivery

4. **Assessment of Head Flexion/Extension**

   - Extended head = ↑ risk of **entrapment**

5. **Placenta Location & Liquor Volume**

   - Rule out **placenta previa**, assess for **polyhydramnios**

6. **Anomaly Scan**

   - Rule out fetal malformations (e.g., hydrocephalus, anencephaly)

### III. Other Investigations (As Needed)

- **MRI**: Rare, used if anomaly suspected
- **Pelvimetry**: Historical; not routinely done but may be used to assess adequacy of pelvis

### Diagnosis Summary Table

| Method                    | Finding                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Abdomen (Fundal grip)** | Hard, ballotable head in fundus            |
| **Pelvic grip**           | Soft breech in pelvis                      |
| **FHS**                   | Above umbilicus                            |
| **USG**                   | Confirms position, type, weight, anomalies |

## Management of Breech Delivery

### I. Prerequisites for Vaginal Breech Delivery

Before planning **vaginal breech delivery**, confirm all of the following:

| Prerequisite               | Criteria                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

### II. Intrapartum Management

#### 1. Admission

- Admit to **tertiary care center**
- Baseline **vitals**, **FHS**, and **pelvic assessment**
- Confirm presentation with **ultrasound**
- Ensure **IV line**, crossmatch blood, **consent for CS**

#### 2. First Stage of Labor

- Monitor labor closely:

  - **CTG** continuously
  - **Progress** of labor (use partograph)

- Avoid early ARM (rupture may ↑ cord prolapse risk)
- **No oxytocin augmentation** unless very slow progress
- **Epidural analgesia** may be offered

#### 3. Second Stage of Labor – Breech Delivery Begins

> - **“Hands-off the breech”** – allow spontaneous delivery till umbilicus<br/>- Support with maneuvers only **if delay or difficulty occurs**

##### Step-by-Step Vaginal Breech Delivery

###### Step 1: Delivery of Buttocks (Breech)

- Allow spontaneous descent
- Support perineum
- Let **buttocks deliver unaided** up to the **umbilicus**

###### Step 2: Delivery of Lower Limbs

- Usually delivered with the buttocks
- If legs are extended (frank breech) and not delivered:

  - Use **Pinard’s maneuver**:

    - Flex knee by pressure in popliteal fossa
    - Abduct and deliver leg gently

###### Step 3: Delivery of Shoulders and Arms

- If arms don’t deliver spontaneously:

  - Use **Lovset’s maneuver**:

    1.  Hold the baby by pelvis, rotate **180°** to bring posterior shoulder anteriorly.
    2.  Deliver posterior arm by sweeping across chest.
    3.  Rotate **back** in opposite direction to deliver other arm.

###### Step 4: Delivery of the After-coming Head

> Most critical part. Must not delay >5 mins after umbilicus delivered!

1. Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit Maneuver

   - Place baby astride the left forearm (prone position)
   - Two fingers in baby’s mouth (or maxilla) to flex the head
   - Right hand supports shoulders
   - Assistant applies **suprapubic pressure**

1. Burns-Marshall Maneuver

   - Let the baby hang (gravity flexes the head)
   - Hold ankles and swing baby **upwards** in arc over maternal abdomen
   - Assistant applies **suprapubic pressure**

1. Forceps (Piper’s) (Only if arms already delivered)

   - Used if head is stuck
   - Piper’s forceps applied to after-coming head
   - Ensure head is flexed

### III. Indications for Emergency Cesarean Section During Labor

- **Fetal distress**
- **Arrest of descent**
- **Cord prolapse**
- **Head extension**
- **Failure of maneuvers**
- **Ineffective uterine contractions**

---

### IV. Third Stage of Labor

- Active Management of Third Stage (AMTSL)

  - Oxytocin 10 IU IM or slow IV
  - Controlled cord traction

- Monitor for **PPH**, trauma
- Inspect **placenta and genital tract**

---

### V. Neonatal Care

- Neonatologist must be present at delivery
- **Resuscitation** readiness (perinatal asphyxia risk)
- Monitor for:

  - **Trauma** (fractures, dislocations)
  - **Neurological status** (from head entrapment/asphyxia)
