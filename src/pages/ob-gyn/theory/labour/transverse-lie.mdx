# Transverse Lie

> **Transverse lie** is an abnormal fetal presentation in which the **long axis of the fetus lies perpendicular** to the **long axis of the uterus**, i.e., the fetus lies **horizontally across the uterus**.

- The **presenting part** is usually the **shoulder**.
- Can be **dorsosuperior** (back up) or **dorsoinferior** (back down).

## Causes of Transverse Lie

> PALM OF HAND

1. **P** – **Placenta previa**

   - Prevents head from entering the pelvis

2. **A** – **Abnormal uterus** (bicornuate, septate, fibroids)

   - Alters fetal accommodation

3. **L** – **Lax uterine/abdominal muscles**

   - Common in grand multiparas

4. **M** – **Multiple pregnancy**

   - Uterine overdistension → abnormal lie

5. **O** – **Oligohydramnios/Polyhydramnios**

   - Alters fetal mobility or space

6. **F** – **Fetal anomalies**

   - Anencephaly, hydrocephalus → head not engaged

7. **H** – **High parity**

   - Lax uterus, reduced tone → malpresentation

8. **A** – **Abdominal wall laxity**

   - Especially after multiple deliveries

9. **N** – **Non-engaged head at term**

   - Primigravida with high head may allow transverse lie

10. **D** – **Delayed labour onset**

- Allows fetal movement, especially in multiparas

## Complications

### Antenatal Complications:

- **Unstable lie** → risk of sudden malpresentation
- **Cord prolapse** (esp. if membranes rupture)
- **Preterm labour**
- **Intrauterine fetal death** (rare, if neglected)
- **Difficulty in diagnosing presentation** → late detection

### Intrapartum Complications:

#### If undiagnosed before labour:

1. **Obstructed labour**

   - Shoulder presentation cannot descend
   - Classical **"neglected shoulder presentation"** in unmonitored labour

2. **Uterine rupture**

   - Strong contractions against a blocked outlet

3. **Cord prolapse**

   - Space beside shoulder → cord slips out on rupture of membranes

4. **Fetal hypoxia / stillbirth**

   - Due to prolonged obstruction and cord compression

5. **Injury to lower uterine segment**

   - Overdistension and attempts at vaginal delivery

### Postpartum Complications:

- **Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)**

  - From uterine atony after prolonged labour or uterine rupture

- **Puerperal sepsis**

  - Due to prolonged rupture of membranes or neglected labour

## Management

### I. Antenatal Management

#### Before 37 weeks:

- Observation, as spontaneous correction is possible

#### After 37 weeks (Term):

1. **Confirm persistent transverse lie**

   - Via clinical exam & ultrasound

2. **Exclude contraindications for vaginal delivery**

   - CPD, placenta previa, fetal anomalies

3. **External Cephalic Version (ECV)**

   - Attempt at 37 weeks if:

     - Singleton pregnancy
     - Normal amniotic fluid
     - Reactive CTG
     - No uterine scar

   - **Contraindications to ECV**:

     - Placenta previa, uterine anomaly, oligohydramnios, multiple pregnancy

4. **If ECV fails or not eligible → Plan Elective Cesarean Section**

   - Usually at **39 weeks**

### II. Intrapartum Management

#### If transverse lie diagnosed during labour:

##### 1. Before labour onset with intact membranes

- **Immediate cesarean section**

##### 2. During labour with ruptured membranes

- **Emergency cesarean section**
- High risk of:

  - Cord prolapse
  - Uterine rupture
  - Obstructed labour

##### 3. Neglected shoulder presentation (rare in modern care)

- **Destructive procedures** (e.g. decapitation) only if fetus is dead and vaginal delivery is the only option (in low-resource settings)
- Otherwise, **cesarean section even in dead fetus**

### III. Postpartum Management

1. **Monitor for complications:**

   - PPH
   - Sepsis (esp. if prolonged labour or rupture of membranes)

2. **Future pregnancy counselling**

   - Higher risk of repeat malpresentation
   - Consider early ultrasound monitoring and elective CS if recurrent

### Delivery Mode Summary

| Scenario                         | Mode of Delivery                    |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| \<37 weeks, stable lie           | Observe / Consider ECV later        |
| ≥37 weeks, persistent transverse | ECV (if eligible) or Elective CS    |
| Labour started, intact membranes | Emergency CS                        |
| Labour + ruptured membranes      | Emergency CS                        |
| Dead fetus, obstructed labour    | Destructive operation (if feasible) |
