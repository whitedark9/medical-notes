# Occipito-Posterior (OP) Position

> A malposition where the **fetal occiput (back of head)** lies **posteriorly** towards the maternal **sacrum** instead of anteriorly toward the pubic symphysis.

- **Common subtypes**:

  - **Right occipito-posterior (ROP)**
  - **Left occipito-posterior (LOP)**

- **Most common malposition** (5–10% at term; often rotates to OA during labour).

## Causes of High Head at Term in Primigravida

> **High head** or **floating head** refers to the baby's head not being engaged in the birth canal, meaning it's not yet settled low into the pelvis. Instead, the baby's head is high above the pelvic brim, potentially posing a risk of obstructed labor.

1. **Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD)**

   - Maternal pelvis too small or fetal head too large

2. **Malposition**

   - Especially **OP** or **occipito-transverse** → poor flexion and rotation

3. **Malpresentation**

   - Brow, face, shoulder presentation → poor engagement

4. **Uterine Inertia**

   - Weak contractions → failure to push fetal head into pelvis

5. **Overdistended Uterus**

   - Polyhydramnios or macrosomia → prevents head descent

6. **Primigravidity**

   - Untried pelvis with less uterine tone and engagement

7. **Placenta Previa**

   - Placenta obstructs the lower uterine segment

8. **Fetal Abnormalities**

   - E.g., hydrocephalus → large head prevents engagement

## Outcomes of Occipito-Posterior Position

### Favourable Outcome

- **Spontaneous rotation to occipito-anterior (OA)** → normal vaginal delivery (\~90% cases)

### Unfavourable Outcomes

1. **Prolonged 1st and 2nd stage of labour**

   - Due to deflexion and wider presenting diameter

2. **Deep Transverse Arrest**

   - Failure to rotate → head stuck in mid-pelvis

3. **Instrumental Delivery**

   - Vacuum or forceps needed due to poor descent

4. **Cesarean Section**

   - Required if rotation fails or CPD suspected

5. **Maternal Exhaustion and Trauma**

   - Long labour → increased fatigue and perineal injury

6. **Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)**

   - Uterine atony from prolonged labour

7. **Fetal Complications**

   - Caput, moulding, asphyxia, birth trauma

<Tabs.Tab>

### 1. Prolonged Labour

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - OP → **deflexed head** → **larger presenting diameter** (occipitofrontal 11.5 cm vs suboccipitobregmatic 9.5 cm in OA)
    → inefficient descent
  - Failure of normal internal rotation
    → poor application of head on cervix → **slow cervical dilatation**

### 2. Deep Transverse Arrest (DTA)

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - In OP, head enters pelvis in **transverse diameter**
  - Internal rotation fails due to poor fit or weak contractions
    → sagittal suture remains in transverse plane
    → **head stuck at ischial spines**

### 3. Obstructed Labour

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Persistent OP + CPD or failed rotation
    → continued ineffective uterine contractions
    → **head cannot descend**
    → **compression of soft tissues** → edema, caput, moulding
    → possible **uterine rupture** if unmanaged

### 4. Instrumental Delivery

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Poor progress in second stage
  - Deflexed head → requires assistance for rotation and delivery
  - Need for **rotational forceps (e.g. Kielland’s)** or **vacuum extraction**

### 5. Cesarean Section

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Labour arrest (first or second stage)
  - DTA or failed instrumental attempt
    → surgical delivery required

### 6. Perineal Trauma

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Deflexed head → **larger diameter stretches perineum**
  - OP rotation increases extension during crowning
    → higher risk of **perineal tears** (including 3rd/4th degree)

### 7. Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH)

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - **Prolonged labour** → uterine fatigue
    → **uterine atony** → poor contraction postpartum
  - Associated perineal trauma or instrumental delivery may contribute

### 8. Fetal Distress / Birth Asphyxia

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Prolonged labour + increased **caput and moulding**
  - Head compression → **reduced placental perfusion**
    → **late decelerations on CTG**
    → fetal acidosis

### 9. Neonatal Trauma

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - **Forceps or vacuum** use → cephalohematoma, scalp lacerations
  - Excessive moulding from prolonged labour
  - Risk of **brachial plexus injury** if shoulder dystocia occurs

### 10. Maternal Exhaustion / Infection

- **Pathophysiology**:

  - Long second stage → maternal fatigue
  - Repeated exams + long labour → ascending infection
  - **Chorioamnionitis, endometritis** risk ↑

## Deep Transverse Arrest (DTA)

> **Deep Transverse Arrest** is a **mechanical obstruction** during the **second stage of labour** where the fetal **head gets arrested in the transverse diameter** of the pelvis at the level of **ischial spines**, typically in **occipito-transverse or persistent occipito-posterior** positions.

- **Key feature**: The head is deep in the pelvis but fails to rotate anteriorly for delivery.

## Causes

> HEAD FAILS

- `H`ypotonic uterine contractions
- `E`pidural anaesthesia (↓ pelvic tone)
- `A`ndroid pelvis (narrow mid-pelvis)
- `D`eflexed head (larger diameters)
- `F`ailure of rotation from OT/OP to OA
- `A`rrested descent due to CPD
- `I`nadequate pushing efforts
- `L`ong 2nd stage → maternal exhaustion
- `S`hort interspinous diameter

## Diagnosis

- **Vaginal examination**:

  - Head at or below **ischial spines** (station 0 or +1)
  - **Sagittal suture in transverse diameter**
  - No descent despite good contractions
  - Failure to rotate anteriorly
  - May have **caput and moulding**

## Management of Deep Transverse Arrest

### General Principles:

- Confirm diagnosis
- Assess for CPD
- Ensure bladder is empty
- Continuous fetal monitoring
- Determine best mode of delivery based on:

  - Station of the head
  - Fetal condition
  - Maternal effort/exhaustion
  - Operator skill

### Delivery Options:

#### 1. Manual Rotation + Forceps

- Rotate head to OA manually
- Apply **non-rotational forceps** (e.g. Neville-Barnes)
- Criteria:

  - No CPD
  - Good contractions
  - Adequate pelvis
  - Skilled operator

#### 2. Rotational Forceps Delivery

- Use **Kielland's forceps** to rotate and deliver
- Requires experience and precise technique

#### 3. Vacuum Extraction (less preferred)

- Only if head is low and rotation minor
- Vacuum not ideal for rotation

#### 4. Cesarean Section

- Indicated when:

  - Manual/rotational attempts fail
  - Suspected CPD
  - Fetal distress
  - Inexperienced operator
  - Maternal exhaustion

### Post-delivery Care:

- Monitor for:

  - **Postpartum hemorrhage**
  - **Perineal/vaginal trauma**
  - **Fetal trauma**

- Counsel for future pregnancies (risk of recurrence)
