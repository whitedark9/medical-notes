# Menopause

## Definition

- **Permanent cessation of menstruation** due to **loss of ovarian follicular activity**
- Diagnosed **retrospectively** after **12 consecutive months of amenorrhea**
- Occurs **naturally**, usually between **45–55 years** (mean ≈ 51 years)

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Diagnosis

- Woman aged **>45 years** with:

  - **12 months amenorrhea** without other cause
  - ± Vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flashes)

### Laboratory Diagnosis (if uncertain or \<45 years)

- **↑ FSH >40 IU/L**
- **↓ Estradiol**
- **TSH** to rule out hypothyroidism
- **Consider AMH** (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) in premature ovarian failure

## Complications of Menopause

### I. Immediate (During Transition / Perimenopause)

- **Menstrual irregularity**
- **Hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms)**
- **Night sweats**
- **Headache**, **dizziness**
- **Mood changes**: anxiety, irritability

### II. Short-Term (Months to Few Years)

- **Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)**:

  - Vaginal dryness
  - Dyspareunia (pain during sex)
  - Pruritus vulvae
  - Recurrent UTIs

- **Sleep disturbances**
- **Cognitive issues** (poor memory, lack of concentration)
- **Loss of libido**

### III. Long-Term (Years After Menopause)

| System             | Complications                                  | Mechanism                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Skeletal**       | **Osteoporosis** → ↑ fracture risk             | ↓ Estrogen → ↑ bone resorption          |
| **Cardiovascular** | ↑ Risk of **ischemic heart disease**, stroke   | Loss of estrogen's protective effect    |
| **Metabolic**      | ↑ Central obesity, **type 2 DM**, dyslipidemia | Hormonal and insulin resistance changes |
| **Psychiatric**    | Depression, cognitive decline                  | Estrogen has neuroprotective effects    |
| **Dermatologic**   | Skin thinning, dry skin                        | ↓ collagen and elasticity               |
| **Breast**         | Loss of breast tissue volume                   | ↓ estrogen and progesterone             |

## Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) in Menopause

> Use of **estrogen ± progestogen** to relieve menopausal symptoms

### I. Benefits of HRT

#### 1. Symptom Relief (Most Evident Benefit)

- ↓ **Vasomotor symptoms** (hot flushes, night sweats)
- ↓ **Genitourinary symptoms** (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia)
- ↓ Mood swings, irritability, sleep disturbance
- ↑ Libido and quality of life

#### 2. Bone Protection

- ↓ Risk of **osteoporosis** and **fragility fractures**
- Especially useful in **early menopause (\<45 yrs)**

#### 3. Reduced Risk of Colorectal Cancer

- Seen with **combined estrogen-progestogen HRT**

#### 4. Favourable Effect on Lipid Profile

- ↓ LDL, ↑ HDL (only when initiated early)

### II. Risks of HRT

| Risk                             | Mechanism                                   | Notes                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)** | Estrogen → ↑ coagulation                    | ↑ risk with **oral HRT**, esp. in obese, smokers |
| **Breast cancer**                | Prolonged **combined HRT** (>5 years)       | Estrogen alone: minimal risk                     |
| **Endometrial cancer**           | **Unopposed estrogen** in women with uterus | Always add **progestogen** if uterus present     |
| **Stroke**                       | Slight ↑ with oral HRT                      | Less with **transdermal route**                  |
| **Gallbladder disease**          | ↑ Risk of **gallstones, cholecystitis**     | Due to hepatic estrogen metabolism               |

### III. Uncertainties and Controversies

| Issue                                  | Uncertainty                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cardiovascular disease protection**  | **Only beneficial** if HRT started in women \<60 yrs or \<10 years since menopause ("timing hypothesis") |
| **Cognitive protection / Alzheimer’s** | No conclusive benefit; may increase risk if started late                                                 |
| **Long-term use**                      | Risk-benefit beyond 5 years is unclear and individualized                                                |
| **Different routes/formulations**      | Transdermal vs. oral vs. local estrogens may have different risk profiles                                |

---

## IV. Key Recommendations (NICE, RCOG)

- Use **lowest effective dose** for **shortest duration**
- Review annually
- For **women \<60** or **within 10 years of menopause**, **benefits outweigh risks**
- **Transdermal HRT** preferred in:

  - VTE risk
  - Gallbladder disease
  - Migraine
