# Utero-Vaginal Prolapse

> **Descent of the uterus and vaginal walls** from their normal anatomical position due to **pelvic floor support failure**, commonly through the vaginal canal.

## Causes (Etiology)

### 1. Childbirth-related

- **Prolonged 2nd stage of labor**
- **Instrumental delivery (forceps, vacuum)**
- **Macrosomia (large baby)**
- **Multiparity** (especially high parity)

### 2. Menopause

- **Estrogen deficiency** → atrophy of pelvic tissues

### 3. Chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure

- Chronic cough (COPD, smoking)
- Constipation, straining
- Obesity
- Ascites
- Heavy lifting

### 4. Neuromuscular or connective tissue weakness

- Congenital collagen disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos)
- Aging

### 5. Previous pelvic surgery

- Hysterectomy without vault support → vault prolapse
- Inadequate pelvic floor repair

## Symptoms

### A. Local Symptoms

- **Feeling of "something coming down" the vagina**
- **Vaginal bulge** or mass
- **Dragging sensation** in pelvis or lower back
- Worsened by standing/prolonged activity
- Relieved by lying down

### B. Urinary Symptoms

- Stress/urge incontinence
- Frequency, urgency
- Incomplete emptying
- Post-void dribbling
- **Obstructive voiding** in complete prolapse

### C. Bowel Symptoms

- Constipation
- Incomplete evacuation
- Need to press vaginal wall (splinting)

### D. Sexual Dysfunction

- Dyspareunia
- Decreased sexual satisfaction
- Vaginal laxity

### E. Vaginal Bleeding or Discharge

- Due to **ulceration** or **infection** of exposed mucosa

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Diagnosis Only

> No imaging is required in **routine cases**. Diagnosis is **entirely clinical** via **speculum and bimanual pelvic exam**.

### A. History

- Symptoms as above
- Obstetric history (parity, delivery mode)
- Menopausal status
- Previous surgeries
- Bowel/bladder/sexual function

### B. Physical Examination

1. **General exam**

   - Look for anemia, nutritional status

2. **Abdominal exam**

   - Look for masses, bladder distension

3. **Pelvic examination**

   - **Dorsal lithotomy position**
   - Use **Sim’s speculum** or **Cusco’s bivalve**
   - Ask patient to cough/strain to assess descent

4. **Identify components of prolapse**:

   - **Uterine prolapse**: cervix descends down
   - **Cystocele**: anterior vaginal wall bulge
   - **Rectocele**: posterior vaginal wall bulge
   - **Enterocele**: central posterior wall bulge (contains bowel)

### C. Grading (POP-Q or Traditional)

#### Traditional grading of uterine descent:

- **1st degree**: Descent into upper vagina
- **2nd degree**: Descent to introitus
- **3rd degree**: Cervix outside introitus
- **Procidentia**: Entire uterus outside vaginal canal

## Investigations (Only if complications/uncertain)

- **Urinalysis / post-void residual** → if urinary symptoms
- **Urodynamic study** → if incontinence suspected
- **Ultrasound / MRI** → rarely needed (e.g. for vault prolapse or enterocele)

# Utero-Vaginal Prolapse – Management

## General Principles

- Depends on:

  - **Severity/grade of prolapse**
  - **Symptoms**
  - **Age**
  - **Desire to retain uterus/fertility**
  - **Comorbidities & fitness for surgery**

## 1. Conservative Management

### A. Lifestyle Modifications

- Weight reduction
- Avoid straining: treat constipation, cough
- Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel's)

### B. Vaginal Pessary

- Rubber or silicone devices inserted into vagina to support pelvic organs

#### Types

- Ring pessary (most common)
- Gellhorn pessary (for more severe cases)

#### Indications

- Unfit for surgery
- Awaiting surgery
- Mild prolapse
- Desire for temporary solution

#### Complications

- Vaginal ulceration
- Infection, discharge
- Pessary expulsion or migration
- Require regular removal and cleaning (every 3–6 months)

## 2. Surgical Management

### A. Uterus-Preserving Surgeries

#### i. Fothergill's (Manchester) Operation

- Indications: 2nd/3rd degree prolapse with **elongated cervix**, fertility desired
- Procedure: Cervical amputation + ligament plication + anterior/posterior repair

#### ii. Sacrohysteropexy (Abdominal or laparoscopic)

- Suspension of uterus to sacral promontory using mesh
- Preferred in young women with **prolapse but uterus preservation desire**

### B. Uterus-Removing Surgeries

#### i. Vaginal Hysterectomy with Pelvic Floor Repair

- Most common definitive surgery in **postmenopausal women** or women not desiring fertility
- Combined with:

  - **Anterior colporrhaphy** (cystocele repair)
  - **Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy** (rectocele repair)

#### ii. Sacrocolpopexy (post-hysterectomy vault prolapse)

- Mesh fixation of vaginal vault to sacrum
- Performed abdominally or laparoscopically

## Surgical Complications

### Intraoperative

- Hemorrhage
- Bladder injury (esp. in anterior repair)
- Ureteric injury
- Bowel injury

### Postoperative

- Infection (UTI, wound, vaginal)
- Pain, urinary retention
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
- Pelvic hematoma

### Long-Term

- **Recurrence of prolapse**
- Dyspareunia
- Vaginal stenosis
- Mesh-related complications (in sacrocolpopexy)

  - Erosion, infection

## Postoperative Advice

- No heavy lifting for 6–12 weeks
- Pelvic floor exercises
- Monitor for infection or voiding difficulty
- Vaginal estrogen (if postmenopausal) to improve tissue quality
