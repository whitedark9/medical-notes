## Types of ECPs

| Type                          | Drug                                | Timing                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Progestogen-only**          | `Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg`             | Within 72 hrs (best \<24h)    |
| **Antiprogestin (UPA)**       | `Ulipristal acetate 30 mg`          | Within 120 hrs (5 days)       |
| **COC (Yuzpe regimen)**       | `Ethinylestradiol + Levonorgestrel` | Within 72 hrs                 |
| **Copper IUD** _(not a pill)_ | —                                   | Within 5 days, most effective |

## Mechanism of Action

### `Levonorgestrel`, `Ulipristal acetate`

- **Inhibits or delays ovulation** → prevents LH surge
- **Prevents fertilization** by altering cervical mucus
- **Alters endometrium** → may inhibit implantation _(controversial)_
  → _Does **not** affect established pregnancy._

### `Yuzpe Regimen` (COC)

- Same as above but less effective, more side effects

### Copper IUD _(for completeness)_

- Spermotoxic effect in uterus and fallopian tubes
- Prevents fertilization and implantation

## Indications

- Unprotected intercourse
- Condom breakage/slippage
- Missed COC/POP pills
- Sexual assault without contraception
- Miscalculated fertile period in NFP users

## Contraindications

### For ECP Pills (Levonorgestrel, UPA)

- **Known pregnancy** (not harmful, but ineffective)
- **Severe liver disease**
- **Uncontrolled asthma** _(for UPA)_
- **Hypersensitivity** to components

### For Copper IUD

- Pregnancy
- Pelvic infection or PID
- Uterine abnormalities
- Wilson disease

## Advantages

- Easily accessible
- Safe and well tolerated
- No long-term hormonal exposure
- Does not require ongoing compliance
- No impact on future fertility
- Can be used multiple times (but not as routine contraception)

## Disadvantages

- Not 100% effective (efficacy ↓ with time delay)
- Irregular bleeding, nausea, vomiting
- No STI protection
- Risk of contraceptive misuse if overused

## Follow-Up

- No need for routine follow-up if:

  - No vomiting within 2 hours of pill
  - Menses occurs within 3 weeks

- **If no menses in 3–4 weeks** → do **UCG** to rule out pregnancy
- Counsel for **long-term contraception**
- If vomiting \<2 hours after ingestion → repeat dose
