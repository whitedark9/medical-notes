# Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs)

> Oral contraceptive pills are **hormonal agents taken orally** to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and inducing endometrial and cervical mucus changes.

## Types

1. **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COC)**

   - Contain `estrogen` (usually `ethinylestradiol`) and **`progestogen`** (e.g., `levonorgestrel`, `norethisterone`)

2. **`Progestogen`-Only Pills (POP)**

   - Contain only `progestogen` (e.g., `norethisterone`, `desogestrel`, `levonorgestrel`)

## Indications

- **Contraception**
- **Menstrual regulation** (heavy, painful, irregular periods)
- **PCOS management**
- **Acne, hirsutism** (COCs with anti-androgenic `progestogen`s)
- **Endometriosis symptom control**
- **Perimenopausal contraception**
- **Functional ovarian cysts**

## Regimen & How to Use

### 1. COC Regimen

- Start on **Day 1–5** of menses

  → Withdrawal bleeding in hormone-free days
- Or **extended use**: 84 active + 7 placebo (seasonal)

**Missed Pill Rule (COC):**
