# Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH)

> **Total Abdominal Hysterectomy (TAH)** is the **surgical removal of the uterus and cervix via an abdominal incision**. It may be with or without removal of adnexa (salpingo-oophorectomy).

## Indications

1. **Symptomatic uterine fibroids**

   - Menorrhagia, pelvic pressure, infertility, large size

2. **Abnormal uterine bleeding** (refractory to medical or conservative treatments)
3. **Adenomyosis** (causing heavy, painful menstruation)
4. **Endometrial hyperplasia** (especially with atypia)
5. **Endometrial carcinoma** (Stage I and II)
6. **Cervical carcinoma** (Selected early-stage cases not suitable for fertility-sparing or radiotherapy)
7. **Ovarian tumor** (benign/malignant with uterine involvement or in postmenopausal woman)
8. **Chronic pelvic pain** (with documented pathology)
9. **Severe pelvic inflammatory disease** or **tubo-ovarian abscess** (refractory)
10. **Placenta accreta/increta/percreta** (as life-saving in obstetric emergency)
11. **Severe endometriosis** (not responding to medical/surgical conservative treatment)
12. **Uterine prolapse** (TAH with vault suspension)

## Complications of TAH

### Intraoperative

- **Hemorrhage** (especially from uterine/ovarian vessels)
- **Injury to adjacent organs**

  - Bladder injury
  - Ureteric injury (especially at the level of cardinal ligament)
  - Bowel injury

- **Anesthetic complications**

### Early postoperative (within 1 week)

- **Hemorrhage/hematoma**
- **Infection**

  - Wound infection
  - Pelvic abscess
  - Urinary tract infection

- **Thromboembolism** (DVT, PE)
- **Ileus or bowel obstruction**
- **Urinary retention**

### Late postoperative

- **Vault granulation** or vault prolapse
- **Chronic pelvic pain**
- **Adhesion formation**
- **Sexual dysfunction** (especially if vaginal shortening)
- **Ovarian failure** (if bilateral oophorectomy done)
- **Psychological distress**

## Prevention of Complications

### Preoperative

- Careful **patient selection** and indication confirmation
- **Optimize comorbidities**: control diabetes, hypertension, anemia
- **Prophylactic antibiotics**: usually `cefazolin` Â± `metronidazole`
- **Thromboprophylaxis**: LMWH + compression stockings
- **Bladder emptying** and bowel prep if indicated

### Intraoperative

- **Good surgical technique** with hemostasis
- Identify and protect **ureters and bladder**
- Use **retractors and diathermy** carefully
- Minimize tissue trauma to reduce adhesions
- Use **absorbable sutures** properly
- Check for bleeding before closure

### Postoperative

- **Early mobilization** to prevent DVT
- Continue **thromboprophylaxis** if needed
- Adequate **pain control** to allow early movement
- Monitor **urine output** and signs of infection
- Wound care and hygiene
