# Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)

> Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) is a **precancerous change** in the squamous epithelium of the cervix characterized by disordered cell maturation and increased proliferation of basal cells.

- It is **graded based on the depth of epithelial involvement** without breaching the basement membrane.

### Grades of CIN

1. **CIN 1 (Mild dysplasia)**

   - Lower 1/3 of epithelium involved
   - Often associated with transient HPV infection

2. **CIN 2 (Moderate dysplasia)**

   - Lower 2/3 of epithelium involved
   - Associated with persistent high-risk HPV

3. **CIN 3 (Severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ)**

   - More than 2/3 to full thickness involved
   - High risk of progression to invasive carcinoma if untreated

## Screening Methods to Prevent Cervical Cancer

### Primary prevention

- **HPV vaccination** (types 16, 18, and others)

  - Given before onset of sexual activity (age 9–14 years optimal)

### Secondary prevention (Cervical screening)

- Detects CIN before it progresses to carcinoma

#### Methods

1. **Pap smear (cytology)**
2. **HPV DNA testing**
3. **Liquid-based cytology (LBC)**
4. **Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA)** – for low-resource settings
5. **Co-testing** – Pap + HPV testing (higher sensitivity)

## Defined Age Groups for Screening

- **Start at age 25 years** (or within 3 years of sexual debut)
- **25–49 years**: every **3 years**
- **50–64 years**: every **5 years**
- **≥65 years**: stop screening if last 3 tests were normal

_Note: Immunocompromised women (e.g. HIV+) should be screened more frequently_

## How to Take a Pap Smear

1. Position woman in **lithotomy** position
2. Insert **Cusco's speculum** gently into the vagina
3. Visualize cervix and remove mucus with a swab
4. Use an **Ayre’s spatula** or **cytobrush**

   - Rotate 360° around the **transformation zone**

5. Spread the sample evenly on a glass slide (conventional smear)

   - OR suspend into preservative fluid (LBC)

6. Fix immediately and label properly
7. Send to cytopathology with clinical details

## Grading of Abnormal Pap Smear

(According to **Bethesda System**)

1. **Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy** (NILM)
2. **ASC-US**: Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
3. **ASC-H**: Atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude HSIL
4. **LSIL**: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 1)
5. **HSIL**: High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2/3)
6. **AGC**: Atypical glandular cells
7. **Squamous cell carcinoma / Adenocarcinoma**

## What is Colposcopy?

> **Colposcopy** is a **magnified visual examination** of the cervix using a **colposcope**, allowing direct visualization of abnormal areas after applying acetic acid or Lugol’s iodine.

### Used for:

- Evaluating abnormal Pap smear results
- Guiding **biopsy** from suspicious areas
- Diagnosing CIN or invasive cancer

### Acetic acid test:

- Areas with **dense aceto-white changes** suggest CIN II/III

### Iodine test:

- **Non-glycogenated epithelium** (CIN) appears **mustard yellow**

## Management

### Principles of Management

- Depends on **grade of CIN**, **age**, **fertility desire**, and **compliance for follow-up**
- Aim: prevent progression to invasive carcinoma while preserving fertility when possible
- **HPV testing and colposcopy** guide management and follow-up

### CIN 1 (Low-grade lesions)

#### General management

- **Observation preferred** (high rate of spontaneous regression)
- Repeat **cytology and/or HPV testing** in 6–12 months

#### Indications for treatment:

- Persistence beyond 2 years
- Patient is non-compliant or lost to follow-up
- Age >35 years with HPV persistence

#### Treatment options:

- **Ablative methods** (only if colposcopy shows entire TZ)

  - **Cryotherapy**
  - **Laser ablation**

- **Excisional methods**

  - **LEEP** (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure)
  - **Cold knife cone biopsy** (if lesion extends into canal or unclear margins)

### CIN 2 and CIN 3 (High-grade lesions)

#### General management:

- **Active treatment required** due to higher risk of progression
- Choice of treatment depends on colposcopic findings and fertility wishes

#### Excisional methods (Preferred):

1. **LEEP** (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure)

   - Outpatient procedure, local anesthesia
   - Removes transformation zone and lesion

2. **Cold Knife Conization**

   - Indicated when:

     - Endocervical involvement
     - Glandular atypia
     - Suspected microinvasion
     - Unsatisfactory colposcopy

3. **Laser excision**

#### Ablative methods (Only if):

- Colposcopy is adequate

- Entire lesion and squamocolumnar junction are visible

- Biopsy confirms CIN 2 or 3

- No suspicion of invasive disease

- Options:

  - **Cryotherapy**
  - **Laser ablation**

### Special Considerations

#### Adolescents and young women with CIN 2

- May be managed **conservatively with close observation**

  - Cytology + colposcopy every 6 months for up to 24 months
  - Treatment if lesion persists or progresses

#### Pregnancy

- **No treatment** unless invasive cancer is suspected
- Repeat colposcopy every trimester
- Definitive treatment deferred until **6–12 weeks postpartum**

### Follow-up After Treatment

- HPV testing and cytology at **6 and 12 months**
- Annual follow-up for at least **5 years**
- Repeat colposcopy if abnormal results reappear

### Complications of Excisional Treatments

- Cervical stenosis
- Bleeding, infection
- Increased risk of **preterm labor** or **cervical incompetence** in future pregnancies
