# Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnancy

> Diabetes in pregnancy includes:<br/>1. **Pre-gestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM)**<br/> - Known **Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes** before pregnancy<br/>2. **Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)**<br/> - Glucose intolerance first recognized during pregnancy (usually diagnosed after 24 weeks).

## Risk Factors

1. BMI > 30 kg/m2
1. Previous macrosomic baby ≥ 4.5 kg
1. Previous GDM
1. Family history of DM
1. Minority ethnic family origin with a high prevalence of DM

## Diagnosis

1. OGTT
1. FBS \> 5.6 mmol/L
1. 2HPP \> 7.8 mmol/L

## Effects of Pregnancy on Diabetes

- ↑ hPL, progesterone, cortisol, GH →
  ↑ **Insulin resistance** (especially after 20 weeks)
- ↑ Risk of **hypoglycemia** in early pregnancy (↑ insulin sensitivity)
- ↑ Risk of **DKA** (esp. in type 1 DM due to metabolic stress)
- ↑ Risk of **worsening diabetic complications**:
  - Retinopathy
  - Nephropathy
  - Cardiovascular disease

## Effects of Diabetes on Pregnancy

### Maternal Complications

#### During Pregnancy

- Miscarriage (esp. if HbA1c > 8%)
- Pre-eclampsia, Pregnancy induced hypertension
- Polyhydramnios
- Easy to get infection: Recurrent UTIs, Vulval and vaginal candidiasis
- Preterm labour
- Worsening of retinal disease
- Worsening of pre-existing renal impairment

#### During Labour

- Obstructed labour due to macrosomia
- Cesarean section

#### During Puerperium

- Puerperal infection

#### Long Term

- Increased risk of T2DM
- GDM in future pregnancies (30-84%)

### Fetal Complications

- **Congenital malformations** (esp. neural tube defect, cardiac disease, caudal regression syndrome) → HbA1c-dependent
- **Macrosomia** → birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, birth asyphyxia
- IUGR (in case of vasculopathy)
- IUFD (especially if poor control)
- Prematurity (in preterm delivery)
- Neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia
- Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia
- Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
- Polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia
- Long-term metabolic syndrome risk

[^1]: Mother's glucose passes through the placenta (`Hyperglycemia`) → Fetal pancreas produces insulin (`Hyperinsulinaemia`) → Diminished surfactant production (`Respiratory distress syndrome`)

[^2]: After delivery, mother's glucose supply was suddenly cut off → `Hyperinsulinaemia` of baby causes `Hypoglycemia`

## Management

### Pre-conecption Management

1. **Optimize glycemic control (target HbA1c < 6.5%)**
   - If HbA1c > 8% → delay conception
2. **Medication review:**
   - Stop oral hypoglycemics (except `metformin` if needed)
   - Switch to `insulin`
   - Stop **ACE inhibitors (e.g. `enalapril`)** → risk of fetal renal anomalies
   - Stop **statins** → teratogenic
3. Start `folic acid 5 mg/day` at least 1 month before conception
4. **Retinal assessment** → risk of worsening retinopathy
5. **Renal function tests** → baseline creatinine, urine ACR
6. **Thyroid function tests** if T1DM
7. Stop smoking
8. Lifestyle modification (Lose weight and diet)

### Antenatal Management

- Multidisciplinary clinic
- More frequent AN visit

#### 1. Glycemic Control

| FBS (mmol/L)                      | Management                     |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| > 7                               | Insulin + Diet ± Metformin     |
| 6-6.9 + Macrosomia/Polyhydramnios | Insulin                        |
| < 7                               | Diet (+ Metformin (+ Insulin)) |

- `Insulin therapy` (basal-bolus or multiple dose regimens)
  - `Glibenclamide` if insulin unavailable
- `Metformin` may be continued in T2DM if well tolerated
- Maintain blood sugar:
  - Fasting 5.3 mmol/L
  - 1-hour postprandial 7.8 mmol/L
  - 2-hour postprandial 6.4 mmol/L
- `Oral 75mg aspirin` for women with proteinuria
- `Beta-blocker` is contraindicated in hypertension with GDM

#### 2. Monitoring

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**
- **HbA1c every trimester**
- **Ultrasound**
  - Dating scan
  - Anomaly scan (18–22 weeks) → cardiac defects
  - Growth scans every 4 weeks from 28 weeks
  - Amniotic fluid index (AFI)
- **Fetal echocardiography** if poor control
- **CTG and BPP** weekly from 36 weeks

#### 3. Complication Screening

- **Renal function** every trimester
- **Retinal check** each trimester
- BP monitoring – screen for pre-eclampsia

### Intrapartum Management

- **Timing of delivery**:
  - Well-controlled, no complications → 38–39 weeks
  - Poor control or complications → earlier (< 37 weeks)
- **Mode of delivery**:
  - Vaginal if estimated fetal weight < 4.5 kg
  - Elective cesarean if macrosomia or obstetric indications
- **Glucose monitoring**:
  - Hourly capillary glucose
  - Maintain 4-7 mmol/L (70–110 mg/dL) using insulin-dextrose infusion if needed

### Postpartum Management

#### Mother

- Type 1/2 DM: ↓ insulin requirement postpartum → adjust dose
- Stop insulin if GDM (test for resolution after 6 weeks)
- Continue SMBG for first 24–48 hrs
- **Immediate breastfeeding** encouraged (↓ insulin need)
- Screen for retinopathy/renal function after delivery

#### Neonate

- Monitor for:
  - **Hypoglycemia** (early feeds, IV glucose if symptomatic)
  - Polycythemia (FBC)
  - Jaundice (Total & Differential Bilirubin)
  - RDS
  - Cardiomyopathy (echocardiography)

### Follow-up

- GDM: Do OGTT, FBS at 6-13 weeks postpartum
- Annual HbA1c screening if GDM history
- Lifestyle modification counselling
- Long-term metabolic health education

## Contraception

- UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC) for contraceptive use

## Factors Associated with Poor Pregnancy Outcome in DM

- Maternal social deprivation
- No folic acid intake prepregnancy
- Suboptimal approach of the woman to manage her diabetes
- Suboptimal preconception care
- Suboptimal glycaemic control at any age
