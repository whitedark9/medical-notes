# Anaemia in Pregnancy – Comprehensive Clinical Note

> Anaemia in pregnancy is defined by WHO as:<br/>- **Hb < 11 g/dL** in the **1st and 3rd trimesters**<br/>- **Hb < 10.5 g/dL** in the **2nd trimester**.

| Severity classification | Hb level     |
| :---------------------- | :----------- |
| Mild                    | 10–10.9 g/dL |
| Moderate                | 7–9.9 g/dL   |
| Severe                  | < 7 g/dL     |

## Causes / Risk Factors

### A. Causes

1. **Nutritional Deficiencies**

   - **Iron deficiency** (most common)
   - Folate deficiency
   - Vitamin B12 deficiency

2. **Chronic Blood Loss**

   - GI bleeding
   - Menorrhagia
   - Frequent pregnancies

3. **Haemoglobinopathies**

   - Thalassemia
   - Sickle cell disease

4. **Bone Marrow Suppression / Failure**

   - Aplastic anaemia
   - Leukaemia

5. **Infections**

   - Malaria
   - Parvovirus B19
   - HIV/TB

### B. Risk Factors

1. Grand multiparity (≥ 5 pregnancies)
1. Short interpregnancy interval
1. Teenage or elderly pregnancy (>35 years)
1. Low socioeconomic status
1. Poor nutritional intake
1. History of anaemia
1. Hookworm infestation
1. Chronic illness
1. Antepartum haemorrhage

## Pathophysiology

- Pregnancy → ↑ Plasma volume by 40–50%
- ↑ Red cell mass only 20–30% → **Haemodilution**
- Iron demand increases (esp. after 20 weeks) →
  ↓ Iron stores →
  **Microcytic hypochromic anaemia (IDA)**
- Iron deficiency → ↓ Hb synthesis → Hypoxia → Compensatory tachycardia & dyspnoea → ↓ Immunity & perinatal outcomes

## Clinical Features

### A. History

- General fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, breathlessness
- Pica (eating non-food items – IDA)
- History of heavy menstrual bleeding
- Dietary history (vegetarian/poor intake)
- Recent illness or infections
- Number and spacing of previous pregnancies

### B. Examination

- Pallor (conjunctiva, tongue, nail beds)
- Koilonychia (spoon nails) – IDA
- Systolic murmur (flow murmur)
- Signs of heart failure in severe anaemia
- Glossitis or angular stomatitis

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **Full blood count (FBC):**

  - ↓ Hb
  - ↓ MCV (microcytic)
  - ↓ MCH (hypochromic)

- **Peripheral blood film:**

  - Microcytic hypochromic in IDA
  - Target cells in thalassemia

- **Serum ferritin** – Low in IDA
- **Serum iron, TIBC** – ↓ iron, ↑ TIBC in IDA

### For Causes

- Stool for ova/cysts (hookworm)
- Hb electrophoresis – Thalassemia/Sickle cell
- Reticulocyte count – Bone marrow response
- Folate and B12 levels
- LFT/RFT if chronic disease suspected

### For Complications

- Echocardiography if signs of heart failure
- Fetal growth assessment – USS
- CTG for fetal well-being if Hb < 7 g/dL

## Management

### A. Pre-pregnancy

- Screening & treatment of anaemia
- Iron supplementation in high-risk women
- Deworming if needed

### B. Antenatal

#### 1. Nutritional Counselling

- Iron-rich foods: meat, liver, green leafy vegetables
- Avoid tea/coffee with meals (↓ absorption)
- Vitamin C with iron improves absorption

#### 2. Medical Treatment

- **Oral Iron (first line):**

  - Ferrous sulphate 200 mg TDS (elemental iron \~60 mg/tablet)
  - Add folic acid 5 mg OD
  - Continue 3 months after correction of Hb

- **Parenteral Iron (if):**

  - Intolerance to oral iron
  - Poor compliance
  - Severe anaemia after 30 weeks
  - Malabsorption
  - Preferred: **Ferric carboxymaltose** (single dose, rapid effect)

- **Blood transfusion (if):**

  - Hb < 7 g/dL or
  - Hb < 9 g/dL with heart failure or symptoms
  - Near term or rapid correction needed

### C. Intrapartum

- Ensure good hydration
- Oxygen support if needed
- Prophylactic antibiotics if at risk
- Active management of third stage of labour (to prevent PPH)
- Cross-matched blood ready if Hb < 8 g/dL

### D. Postpartum

- Continue iron therapy for 3–6 months
- Treat underlying cause
- Family planning counselling to increase birth spacing
- Deworming if not already done
- Dietary education

## Complications

### Maternal

- Fatigue, poor work performance
- Infections
- Preterm labour
- Cardiac failure
- PPH due to poor uterine tone
- Death in severe untreated anaemia

### Fetal

- IUGR
- Preterm birth
- Low birth weight
- Intrauterine death
- Neonatal anaemia
