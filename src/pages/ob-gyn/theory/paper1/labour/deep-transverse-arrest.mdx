# Deep Transverse Arrest (DTA)

- Failure of rotation of the fetal head from **occipito-transverse** to **occipito-anterior (OA)**
- Despite full cervical dilation and descent to pelvic floor
- **Head is arrested in the transverse diameter** at or below the **ischial spines**
- Usually occurs in **second stage of labor**

## Detailed Management of Deep Transverse Arrest

### Initial Assessment & Preparation

1. **Confirm Diagnosis**

   - Per vaginal exam: sagittal suture in transverse diameter, anterior fontanelle felt
   - Full cervical dilatation
   - No progress in descent or rotation
   - Confirm absence of CPD clinically

2. **Check Prerequisites for Operative Delivery**

   - Adequate pelvis
   - Fetus alive and not macrosomic
   - Head at station ≥ +2
   - Full cervical dilation
   - Membranes ruptured
   - Experienced operator
   - No fetal distress (unless emergency CS)

3. **Stabilization**

   - IV access
   - Cross-matched blood ready
   - Informed consent
   - Foley catheter (to empty bladder)
   - Position mother in lithotomy

### If Fetus is Alive

#### Option 1: Manual Rotation + Forceps Delivery

- Preferred if head is low and rotation is possible manually

**Steps:**

1. Insert hand to grasp fetal head
2. Gently rotate occiput to anterior
3. Immediately apply **Simpson's or Tucker-McLane forceps** to maintain position
4. Deliver head gently with contractions and traction

**Note**: Attempt only if:

- No CPD
- Skilled operator
- Good contractions

#### Option 2: Rotational Forceps (Kielland’s Forceps)

- Used when manual rotation is unsuccessful or not possible

**Steps:**

1. Apply **Kielland's forceps** to fetal head in transverse position
2. Gently rotate head to occipito-anterior
3. Deliver with traction

**Risks**: Vaginal and fetal trauma
**Requires**: High skill level and careful traction

#### Option 3: Cesarean Section

- Indicated when:

  - Manual or rotational forceps fail
  - Inadequate pelvis or suspicion of CPD
  - Fetal distress
  - No skilled operator for forceps delivery

**Procedure:**

- Usually **lower segment CS**
- If deeply impacted head → may require:

  - Reverse breech extraction
  - Push from below per vaginum by assistant

### If Fetus is Dead

#### Option: Craniotomy

- Destructive operation to reduce head size and allow vaginal delivery

**Indications:**

- Confirmed IUFD
- Favorable cervix and pelvis
- Skilled operator

**Procedure:**

- Perforate fetal skull
- Evacuate contents
- Deliver collapsed head

> _Used only in resource-limited settings with experienced operator_

## Post-delivery Management

### Mother

- Inspect for:

  - Vaginal/cervical tears
  - Uterine rupture (if prolonged labor)

- Manage **PPH**
- Broad-spectrum **antibiotics** if prolonged labor or intervention
- **Counseling** for future pregnancy (risk of recurrence)

### Neonate

- Resuscitation team present during delivery
- Monitor for trauma or asphyxia

## Summary Table

| Scenario                             | Preferred Management      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Head low, no CPD, skilled staff      | Manual rotation + forceps |
| Rotation fails or high head          | Kielland’s forceps        |
| Rotation fails or fetal distress/CPD | Cesarean section          |
| Fetal death, skilled staff           | Craniotomy                |

## Place of Management

- **Tertiary-level facility** with:

  - Operation theatre
  - Skilled obstetrician
  - Neonatal resuscitation
  - Blood transfusion available
