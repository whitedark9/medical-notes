# Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC)

## Definition

- **VBAC**: Vaginal delivery in a woman who has had a previous **Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS)**.
- **TOLAC (Trial of Labour After Caesarean)**: Planned attempt at vaginal delivery in women with previous LSCS.

## Modes of Delivery

1. **Planned Elective Repeat Caesarean Section (ERCS)**
2. **Planned VBAC** if criteria met

## Requirements for VBAC (Eligibility Criteria)

- One **previous uncomplicated LSCS** with **transverse lower uterine segment incision**
- **Singleton** pregnancy
- **Cephalic presentation**
- **≥37 weeks** gestation
- **No other contraindications to vaginal delivery** (e.g. placenta previa, malpresentation)
- **No history of uterine rupture**
- **No classical (vertical) uterine scar or multiple CS scars**
- **Facility available for emergency CS** (24-hour OT, blood, experienced team)
- **Informed consent obtained**

## Factors Influencing Successful VBAC

> LIP BBC

- **Spontaneous onset of `l`abour**
- **Inter-delivery `i`nterval ≥18 months**
- `P`revious **vaginal delivery**, especially **VBAC**
- **`B`ishop score ≥6**
- **Normal maternal `B`MI**
- Absence of **complicating medical or obstetric `c`onditions** (e.g. DM, PIH)

## Risk Factors for Failed VBAC or Uterine Rupture

- **Induction of labour** (especially with prostaglandins)
- **Short inter-pregnancy interval (\<18 months)**
- **Macrosomia (>4 kg)**
- **Obstructed labour**
- **Previous uterine rupture**
- **Multiple previous CS**

## Success Rate

- Overall: **60–80%**
- ↑ if previous vaginal birth or spontaneous labour
- ↓ if:

  - Labour induction needed
  - Obesity
  - Advanced maternal age
  - Short interpregnancy interval

## Management for VBA

### Pre-conception / Antenatal

- **History review:** Number and type of previous CS, indication
- **Counselling:** Risks vs. benefits of VBAC vs. Elective Repeat CS (ERCS)
- **Antenatal monitoring:** Growth scans, placental location (exclude previa/PAS)

### Intrapartum

#### 1st Stage

- **Place:** Hospital with 24-hour OT, anesthesia, blood bank
- **Time:** Elective admission at 39 weeks for trial of labour
- **Mode:** Allow spontaneous labour or gentle oxytocin augmentation (avoid prostaglandins)

**Monitoring:**

- Continuous **CTG** for fetal distress
- Observe for signs of **uterine rupture** (e.g., pain, bleeding, bradycardia)
- **Avoid prolonged labour**

#### 2nd Stage

- Shorten if needed with **instrumental delivery**
- Avoid fundal pressure

#### 3rd Stage

- Active management to prevent **PPH**
- Inspect uterus for scar integrity if PPH occurs

### Postpartum

- **Maternal:** Monitor for PPH, sepsis, uterine rupture
- **Neonatal:** Resuscitation team on standby during VBAC

### Contraception

- Best: **Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)** (e.g., LNG-IUD, implant)
- Avoid: Immediate post-partum IUD if traumatic delivery

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type of previous CS**          | - Most suitable for VBAC: **Low transverse LSCS**<br/>- **Classical (vertical) incision**: contraindicated                   |
| **Number of previous CS**        | - VBAC usually allowed after **only one LSCS**<br/>- ≥2 CS: generally recommend **Elective Repeat CS (ERCS)**                |
| **Indication for previous CS**   | - If **non-recurrent** (e.g., fetal distress), VBAC more likely successful<br/>- If **recurrent** (e.g., CPD), consider ERCS |
| **Maternal and fetal condition** | - No contraindications (e.g., previa, malpresentation, uterine rupture risk)                                                 |
| **Benefits of VBAC**             | - Avoids major surgery<br/>- Faster recovery<br/>- Less risk of future placental problems (e.g., accreta)                    |
| **Risks of VBAC**                | - Uterine rupture (\~0.5–1%)<br/>- Emergency CS if labour fails<br/>- Risk of PPH, fetal hypoxia                             |
| **Benefits of ERCS**             | - Predictable and planned<br/>- Avoids labour-related rupture risk                                                           |
| **Risks of ERCS**                | - Surgical risks (adhesions, bleeding, infection)<br/>- Delayed recovery<br/>- Future placenta accreta risk increases        |
| **Availability of facilities**   | - VBAC should be done only where **emergency CS is available immediately**                                                   |
| **Success rate of VBAC**         | - \~60–80% success with proper selection                                                                                     |
| **Delivery plan**                | - Regular antenatal care<br/>- Final decision made by \~36–37 weeks<br/>- Admission at 39 weeks for planned VBAC or ERCS     |
