## Vacuum-Assisted Vaginal Delivery (Ventouse Delivery)

- **Operative vaginal delivery** using a suction cup (ventouse)
- Applied to the fetal scalp → traction applied during uterine contractions
- Used to assist **second stage of labor**

## Procedure

### I. Preparation

#### 1. Confirm Indication & Prerequisites

Ensure:

- **Full cervical dilation** (10 cm)
- **Ruptured membranes**
- **Engaged head** (station ≥ +2)
- **Known fetal position**
- **No cephalopelvic disproportion**
- **Empty bladder** (catheterize if needed)
- **Informed consent** obtained

#### 2. Equipment Preparation

- Sterile **vacuum cup** (soft or rigid)
- **Vacuum machine** or manual pump
- **Suction tubing**
- Sterile gloves, lubricant
- **Resuscitation equipment for newborn**
- **Forceps and CS set** ready in case of failure

---

### II. Procedure Steps

#### 1. Position the Mother

- **Lithotomy position**
- Ensure good lighting and access

#### 2. Aseptic Technique

- Scrub, sterile gloves
- Clean vulva and perineum with antiseptic
- Drape the patient

#### 3. Identify the Fetal Position

- Use **vaginal examination** to locate:

  - **Posterior fontanelle**
  - **Sagittal suture**

→ Helps to identify **flexion point**

#### 4. Insert Vacuum Cup

- Choose appropriate cup size (usually 5–6 cm)
- Insert cup into vagina **with anterior edge facing pubic symphysis**
- Place **center of cup on flexion point**:
  → **3 cm anterior to posterior fontanelle**, over sagittal suture
  → Ensures proper flexion during traction

#### 5. Create the Vacuum

- Check cup seal and fetal scalp
- Remove air from the tubing
- **Stepwise suction:**

  1. Start with **100–150 mmHg** to confirm seal
  2. Then increase to **500–600 mmHg**

#### 6. Apply Traction (With Each Contraction)

- Wait for uterine contraction and maternal pushing
- Apply **downward traction initially**, then follow:
  → **Curve of Carus** (downward → horizontal → upward)
- Maintain **in-line axis traction** with fetal head
- Traction should be **intermittent**, **coordinated** with contractions

#### 7. Monitor Progress

- Descent should occur with **every pull**
- Delivery usually within **3 pulls or 15–20 minutes**
- Limit to **2 cup detachments ("pop-offs")**

#### 8. Delivery of Head

- Once head visible, release vacuum slowly
- Remove cup
- Deliver head and rest of body as in normal vaginal delivery

---

### III. Post-Delivery Care

#### Newborn

- Assess for:

  - **Cephalohematoma**
  - **Scalp abrasions**
  - **Jaundice** (later from hematoma resorption)
  - **Subgaleal hemorrhage** (swelling crossing suture lines)

- Neonatal resuscitation team must be present

#### Mother

- Examine **vaginal walls, cervix, and perineum** for trauma
- Manage **PPH** if occurs
- Provide **analgesia** and emotional support

---

### IV. Criteria for Abandoning Procedure

Stop and proceed to **cesarean section** if:

- No descent after **3 pulls**
- Delivery not achieved in **15–20 minutes**
- **≥2 pop-offs**
- **Fetal distress** develops
- **Cup misplacement** or bleeding occurs
