# Instrumental Vaginal Delivery (Operative Vaginal Delivery)

> Delivery of the fetus using instruments (either **forceps** or **vacuum/ventouse**) to assist during the **second stage of labour** when spontaneous vaginal delivery is not possible or safe.

## Types of Forceps

| Forceps           | Type           | Use                           |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Simpson**       | Non-rotational | Moulded head, OA              |
| **Elliot**        | Non-rotational | Unmoulded head                |
| **Tucker-McLane** | Non-rotational | OA positions                  |
| **Kielland**      | Rotational     | OP/OT, deep transverse arrest |
| **Piper**         | Special        | After-coming head in breech   |
| **Wrigley’s**     | Outlet         | Cesarean or low head          |

## Indications

### A. Fetal Indications

- **Non-reassuring fetal heart rate** (e.g., late decelerations, bradycardia)
- **Prolapsed umbilical cord** (if head is low and delivery imminent)

### B. Maternal Indications

- **Prolonged second stage of labour**

  - Primigravida: >2 hrs (no epidural), >3 hrs (with epidural)
  - Multipara: >1 hr (no epidural), >2 hrs (with epidural)

- **Maternal exhaustion**
- Maternal medical conditions where pushing is contraindicated or harmful:

  - Cardiac disease (e.g., mitral stenosis)
  - Neurological disorders (e.g., aneurysm, retinopathy)

## **Special Note**

- **Subgaleal hemorrhage** is a **life-threatening complication of vacuum** → must monitor head swelling that crosses suture lines and for signs of hypovolemia.
- **Facial nerve palsy** is typically **forceps-related**, especially with blade compression near the stylomastoid foramen.
