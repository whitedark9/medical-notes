# Puerperal Pyrexia & Puerperal Sepsis

## Puerperal Pyrexia

- **Any fever ≥38°C (100.4°F)**
- Occurring **within the first 14 days** postpartum
- On **any 2 consecutive days** (excluding the first 24 hours)

## Puerperal Sepsis[^1]

- **Infection of the genital tract** occurring **at any time between onset of labor and the 42nd day postpartum**, accompanied by:

  - Fever ≥38°C
  - Pelvic pain
  - Abnormal vaginal discharge/foul-smelling lochia
  - Delay in uterine involution

[^1]: Sepsis = systemic inflammatory response to infection

## Sources of Infection in Puerperal Sepsis

| Source                              | Explanation                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Endometrium (endometritis)**      | Most common source → infected placental bed                          |
| **Vaginal/cervical lacerations**    | Open wounds → easy bacterial entry                                   |
| **Episiotomy or perineal tears**    | Poor hygiene or suture technique can lead to infection               |
| **Cesarean section wound**          | Surgical site infection common in emergency or unsterile settings    |
| **Retained products of conception** | Necrotic tissue acts as nidus for infection                          |
| **Ascending vaginal flora**         | Opportunistic organisms ascend post-delivery when cervix is open     |
| **Invasive procedures**             | Multiple vaginal exams, unsterile instruments → direct contamination |
| **Urinary tract infection**         | Catheterization can introduce bacteria → ascending UTI               |
| **Breast infections (mastitis)**    | Can cause fever in postpartum but not genital source                 |

## Common Causative Organisms

### A. Endogenous (from vaginal flora)

1. **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)** – _Streptococcus pyogenes_
   → Rapidly invasive, can cause **toxic shock**

2. **Group B Streptococcus (GBS)** – _Streptococcus agalactiae_
   → Neonatal and maternal sepsis

3. **Escherichia coli**
   → From GI tract, causes UTI, wound infection

4. **Anaerobes** – _Bacteroides spp._, _Peptostreptococcus_
   → Associated with **foul-smelling lochia**

5. **Enterococcus spp.**

6. **Staphylococcus aureus**
   → Especially in wound infections

### B. Exogenous (Hospital-acquired)

- **Pseudomonas**
- **Klebsiella**
- **Proteus**
- **MRSA** (rare but serious)
