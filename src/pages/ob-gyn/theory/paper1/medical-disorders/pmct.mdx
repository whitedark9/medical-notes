# Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV (PMCT)

> Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) includes **all strategies used to prevent HIV transmission** from an HIV-positive mother to her child during **pregnancy, labor and delivery, or breastfeeding**.

## Routes of Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT)

1. **Intrauterine (5–10%)**

   - Transplacental passage of virus during pregnancy

2. **Intrapartum (10–20%)**

   - Exposure to infected maternal blood and secretions during labor

3. **Postnatal (via breastfeeding) (5–20%)**

   - Transmission through breast milk (risk ↑ with mixed feeding)

## Risk Factors for Vertical Transmission

1. High maternal viral load
2. Low maternal CD4 count (\<200 cells/mm³)
3. Lack of ART during pregnancy
4. Prolonged rupture of membranes (>4 hours)
5. Invasive procedures (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy, instrumental delivery)
6. Mixed or prolonged breastfeeding

Other risk factors:

- Maternal STIs or infections
- Prematurity or low birth weight
- Vaginal delivery when viral load is high

## Four Key Interventions for PMTCT

1. **Antiretroviral therapy (ART)** to mother and infant
2. **Safe delivery practices** (mode of delivery depending on viral load)
3. **Safe infant feeding practices** (exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive formula)
4. **Early infant diagnosis and treatment**

## Transmission Risk With and Without Interventions

| Scenario                         | Risk of MTCT |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Without any intervention**     | 15–45%       |
| **With full PMTCT intervention** | \<1–2%       |
| **With ART alone**               | \~2–5%       |
| **With breastfeeding (mixed)**   | Up to 20%    |

## Management

### Pre-conception

1. Medical Assessment

   - CD4 count, viral load
   - Screen: STIs, Hep B/C, TB, cervical cancer
   - Treat co-morbidities

2. ART Optimization

   - Continue effective ART (e.g. **TDF + 3TC + DTG**)
   - Ensure viral load **\<50 copies/mL for ≥3–6 months**
   - Avoid teratogenic drugs (e.g. Efavirenz early pregnancy if possible)

3. Partner Testing

   - If HIV-negative:

     - Offer **PrEP** (Tenofovir/Emtricitabine)
     - Time unprotected sex during ovulation

   - If HIV-positive: Ensure **viral suppression in both**

4. Immunization & Supplements

   - Rubella, Hep B, Varicella
   - **Folic acid 5 mg/day**, start 3 months pre-conception

5. Fertility & Safe Conception

   - Natural conception if both are suppressed
   - Assisted methods (e.g. sperm washing) if discordant couple

6. Counselling

   - PMTCT importance
   - Adherence to ART
   - Family planning
   - Mental health & disclosure support

### Antenatal Care

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Obstetrician + HIV specialist + Paediatrician

- **Confirm diagnosis**

  - Repeat HIV test if first diagnosis
  - Baseline **CD4 count, viral load, resistance testing**
  - Screen for **STIs, Hepatitis B/C, TB**

- **Start ART immediately (regardless of CD4 count or viral load)**

  - **Regimen** (first-line WHO recommended):

    - **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg + Lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg + Dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg**, once daily

  - Counsel about **side effects**, **compliance**, and **lifelong therapy**

- **Monitor**

  - CD4, viral load every trimester
  - CBC, renal, liver function
  - Ultrasound for fetal growth & anomalies
  - Counselling on **infant feeding options**

- **Avoid** invasive procedures (amniocentesis, scalp electrodes)

### Intrapartum Care

- **Mode of delivery**

  - **Viral load \<50 copies/mL** → **Vaginal delivery acceptable**
  - **Viral load >1000 copies/mL** → **Elective caesarean section at 38 weeks**
  - Avoid artificial rupture of membranes unless necessary

- **Intrapartum ART**

  - Continue maternal ART
  - **IV Zidovudine** (2 mg/kg loading dose, then 1 mg/kg/hr infusion) if:

    - Not on ART or started \<4 weeks ago
    - High viral load at delivery

- **Avoid** episiotomy, instrumental delivery, fetal blood sampling

### Postpartum Care

- **Mother**

  - Continue lifelong ART
  - Contraceptive counselling

    - Prefer **progestin-only or IUD**

  - Counsel on exclusive infant feeding (no mixed feeding)

- **Infant**

  - Start **Neonatal prophylaxis**

    - If mother on ART with suppressed viral load:

      - **Zidovudine (AZT)** 4 mg/kg PO BD for 4 weeks

    - If high-risk (no ART, late ART, high viral load):

      - **Zidovudine + Nevirapine (NVP)** 2 mg/kg PO daily × 6 weeks

- **Early Infant Diagnosis (EID)**

  - **HIV PCR test** at **6 weeks**
  - **Antibody test** after 18 months
  - Breastfed infants: test 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding

- **Immunizations**

  - Avoid **BCG** and **live vaccines** until HIV status confirmed if symptomatic
  - Give **routine immunizations** per national schedule

### Follow-Up

- **Mother**

  - Regular HIV clinic visits for viral load and CD4 monitoring
  - Adherence counselling

- **Infant**

  - Growth and developmental monitoring
  - Regular HIV testing until final diagnosis
  - Nutritional support and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis from 6 weeks (if needed)

### Summary

| Step            | Actions                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Antenatal**   | ART initiation, viral monitoring, feeding counselling   |
| **Intrapartum** | Mode of delivery based on viral load, minimize exposure |
| **Postpartum**  | ART continuation, neonatal prophylaxis, safe feeding    |
| **Follow-up**   | Infant HIV testing, growth, maternal ART adherence      |
