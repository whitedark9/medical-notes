# Maternal Motality Rate (MMR)

## Maternal Death

> Death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy,<br/>Irrespective of duration or site of pregnancy,<br/>From any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management,<br/>But not from accidental or incidental causes.

## Classification of Maternal Death

### 1. Direct Maternal Death

- Resulting from obstetric complications of pregnancy, labor, or puerperium
- Examples:

  - PPH
  - Eclampsia
  - Sepsis
  - Obstructed labor

### 2. Indirect Maternal Death

- Resulting from pre-existing disease or disease developed during pregnancy
- Not due to direct obstetric causes but **aggravated by pregnancy**
- Examples:

  - Rheumatic heart disease
  - Anemia
  - Tuberculosis

### 3. Late Maternal Death

- Death of a woman from direct or indirect causes **more than 42 days but within 1 year** of termination of pregnancy

### 4. Coincidental / Accidental Death

- Unrelated to pregnancy or its management
- Examples:

  - Road traffic accident
  - Homicide
  - Cancer

## Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)

> **Number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births**; Indicator of quality of maternal health care

```math
\text{MMR} = \frac{\text{Number of maternal deaths}}{\text{Number of live births}}
```

## Fall in Maternal Deaths

- Improved access to healthcare
- Enhanced family planning services
- Reduction in infectious diseases
- Education and awareness
- Better nutrition and overall health
- Policy intitiatives and investments
- Technological advancements
- Reduction in unsafe abortions

## Causes

- Early Pregnancy
  - Septic abortions
  - Ectopic pregnancy
  - H. mole
- Late pregnancy
  - APH: Placenta praevia, abruption placenta
  - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
- During labour
  - PPH
  - Injuries, rupture of uterus, tears
  - Amnioitic fluid embolism
  - Pulmonary embolism
  - Sepsis
- Others
  - Medical diseases such as heart disease, malaria, etc.

## Measures to Reduce MMR From PPH

- ANC provision including blood group and Rh typing
- Correction of anaemia
- Identification of high risk cases
- Referral for hospital delivery in cases with high risk of PPH
- Delivery by skilled personal
- Presence of emergency transport system
- Upgrading of blood bank services
- Active management of 3rd stage of labour
- If PPH occurs, management should be timely, promptly and appropriately
- Team Work: Multidisciplinary approach
- Speed
- Avoid: Delay in making diagnosis, Delay in alerting, Mobilizing
- Responsible persons
- Stepwise and rapid intervention
- There must be **Hospital Protocol**
- Training of obstetric team
