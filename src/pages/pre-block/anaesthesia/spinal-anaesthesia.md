# Spinal Anaesthesia (SAB)

> Type of regional block in which local anaesthesia is injected into the subarachnoid space in the lumbar region, affecting lower body areas.

- Spinal anesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium channels** in the neuronal membrane, preventing the initiation and propagation of **nerve impulses**.
- The effect is **reversible**, allowing normal sensation to return after the drug wears off
- e.g., `Lidocaine`, `Bupivacaine`

## Types of Regional Anaesthesia

1. Neuraxial blocks (central nerve blocks)
   - Spinal (Intrathecal) :Inject into subarachnoid space
   - Epidural: Inject into epidural space
   - Caudal: Inject into caudal space
1. Peripheral blocks
   - Upper limbs
   - Lower limbs
   - Trunk
1. Field blocks
   - Small localized area

## Indications

Surgeries below umbilicus

1. **General**: Appendicitis, Hernia, Hydrocele
1. **Urology**: Renal stones, Genital warts & genital ulcer surgeries
1. **Obstetric and Gynaecology**: Cesarean Section, Ovarian cysts, Sterilization
1. **Orthopaedics**: Lower limb orthosurgery

Surgeries above umbilicus

- In combination with `general anaesthesia` or `epidural`

## Contraindications

### Absolute

- Lack of consent
- Infection at the site of injection (Risk of infection spread into brain, meningitis)
- Coagulopathy (Risk of vertebral hematoma, nerve injury)
- Severe hypovolemia (Risk hypovolemic shock)
- Increase intracranial pressure (Risk of brain hernia)

### Relative

- Uncooperative patient
- Sepsis (e.g., DM foot, compartment syndrome)
- Pre-existing neurological deficits (e.g., numbness, paraplegia)
- Demyelinating lesions [^1] (Need more time to reach the usual anaesthetic effect)
- Severe spinal deformity (e.g, scoliosis, kyphosis, lordosis)
- Stenotic valvular heart lesions (One of the heart valves is narrow and decrease relative systemic hypovoleaemia)
- Left ventricular outflow obstruction

[^1]: Myelin sheath sorrounds and protects the nerve fibers in the CNS. It is destroyed in **Demyelinating lesions**.

### Controversial

- Previous back surgery at the site of injection
- Complicated surgery
- Prolonged operation
- Major blood loss
- Maneuvers that compromise respiration (e.g, prone position, jackknife position)

## Performing SAB

1. Preparation
   - Full monitoring
   - Wide-bore IV access
   - Sterile technique
1. Positioning
   - Lateral decubitus position
   - Sitting
   - Jackknife

## Drugs Used in SAB

- Only preservative free agents should be used
- Hyperbaric [^2], isobaric, hypobaric solutions such as `bupivacaine`, `levobupivacaine`, `prilocaine` and `chloroprocaine`
- Adjuvant medications
  - `Clonidine`: Decrease post-op shivering, post-op nausea and vomiting, emergence delirium
  - `Benzodiazipine`: Decrease pre-op anxiety, mild sedation, emergence phenomenon
  - `Melatonin`: Hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic properties
  - `Antiemetic agents`: Prevent nausea and vomiting
  - `NSAIDs`: Analgesics

[^2]: **Hyerbaric solution**: A solution that is higher than atomospheric pressure; **Isobaric**: The same; **Hypobaric**: Lower than;

## Complications

### Immediate

- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- High block (Higher than the expected level)
- Total spinal block
- Anaphylaxis (Due to hypersensitivity)
- Urinary retension
- ~~Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)~~ [^3]

[^3]: **LAST**: Life-threatening condition when LA is absorbed into the systemic circulation in excessive amounts.

### Late

- Backache
- Post-Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)
- Cranial nerve palsy
- Meningitis
- Spinal cord or nerve root injury
- Vertebral canal haematoma
