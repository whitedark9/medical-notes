# Anatomy of the Lung

## Gross Anatomy

### Right Lung

- **Lobes**: Three lobes (superior, middle, inferior).
- **Fissures**: Horizontal fissure (between superior and middle lobes), oblique fissure (between middle and inferior lobes).

### Left Lung

- **Lobes**: Two lobes (superior and inferior).
- **Fissures**: Oblique fissure (separates superior and inferior lobes).
- **Lingula**: Tongue-like projection of the superior lobe, analogous to the middle lobe of the right lung.

## Bronchial Tree

### Trachea

- Bifurcates at the carina (T4-T5 level) into the main bronchi.

### Main Bronchi

- **Right Main Bronchus**: Wider, shorter, more vertical.
- **Left Main Bronchus**: Narrower, longer, more horizontal.

### Lobar Bronchi

- **Right**: Three lobar bronchi (one for each lobe).
- **Left**: Two lobar bronchi (one for each lobe).

### Segmental Bronchi

- Branch from lobar bronchi, each supplying a bronchopulmonary segment.

### Bronchopulmonary Segments

- Functionally and anatomically distinct regions of the lungs.
- Each segment has its own segmental bronchus and vascular supply.
- **Right lung**: 10 segments.
- **Left lung**: 8-10 segments (variation in the number).

### Alveoli

- Microscopic air sacs where gas exchange occurs.
- Clustered in alveolar sacs at the ends of alveolar ducts.

## Pleura

- **Parietal Pleura**: Lines the thoracic cavity.
- **Visceral Pleura**: Covers the lung surface.
- **Pleural Cavity**: Potential space between parietal and visceral pleura, contains a small amount of lubricating fluid.

## Blood Supply

- **Pulmonary Circulation**: Pulmonary arteries (deoxygenated blood to lungs), pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood to heart).
- **Bronchial Circulation**: Bronchial arteries (oxygenated blood to lung tissues), bronchial veins (drain into pulmonary veins or azygos system).

## Nerve Supply

- **Pulmonary Plexus**: Sympathetic (bronchodilation), parasympathetic (bronchoconstriction via the vagus nerve (Cranial X nerve)).
- **Phrenic Nerve**: Innervates the diaphragm.

## Applied Anatomy

### Pathological Conditions

#### Pneumonia

- Infection causing **inflammation** and **consolidation** of lung tissue.
- Appears as `localized opacity` on chest X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Cough, fever, chest pain, dyspnea.

#### Pneumothorax

![Pneumothorax](/radiology/hemopneumothorax.jpg)

- **Air** in the pleural cavity causing lung collapse.
- Appears as a `lack of lung markings` and `visible pleural line` on X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Sudden chest pain, shortness of breath.

#### Pleural Effusion

![Pleural Disorders](/radiology/pleural-disorders.jpg)

- Accumulation of **fluid** in the pleural space.
- Appears as `blunting of costophrenic angles` and `meniscus sign` on X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain.

#### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

- Includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
- `Hyperinflation`, `flattened diaphragm`, and `increased retrosternal space` on X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Chronic cough, sputum production, dyspnea.

#### Lung Cancer

- Malignant tumors in the lung tissue.
- Appears as a localized `mass or nodule` on X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Persistent cough, hemoptysis, weight loss.

#### Tuberculosis (TB)

- Infectious disease causing granulomas in lung tissue.
- `Cavitations`, `nodules`, and `infiltrates`, `particularly in upper lobes` on X-ray.
- **Symptoms**: Chronic cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss.

### Clinical Procedures

#### Thoracentesis

- Procedure **to remove fluid** from the pleural space.
- Performed at the `mid-axillary line in the 7th or 8th intercostal space`.

#### Chest Tube Insertion

- Used **to drain air, blood, or fluid** from the pleural cavity.
- Inserted in the `4th or 5th intercostal space, mid-axillary line`.

#### Bronchoscopy

- Endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree.
- Used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

#### Lung Biopsy

- Procedure to obtain lung tissue for histopathological examination.
- Can be performed via bronchoscopy, needle biopsy, or surgical biopsy.
