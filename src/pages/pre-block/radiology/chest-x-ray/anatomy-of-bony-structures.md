## Ribs

### Structure [#Ribs]

- 12 pairs of ribs:
  - `True Ribs (1-7)`: Directly attach to the sternum via their own costal cartilages.
  - `False Ribs (8-10)`: Attach to the sternum indirectly via the costal cartilage of the rib above.
  - `Floating Ribs (11-12)`: Do not attach to the sternum.
- Each rib has a head, neck, tubercle, and body.
- Ribs form the rib cage, providing **protection to the thoracic organs**.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Ribs]

- Curving shadows that increase in size from the first rib downwards.
- Posterior parts of the ribs are more horizontal and prominent.
- Anterior parts of the ribs curve downward.

## Clavicles

### Structure [#Clavicles]

- Long, S-shaped bones located horizontally at the top of the thoracic cage.
- Medial end articulates with the `manubrium of the sternum`.
- Lateral end articulates with the `acromion of the scapula`.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Clavicles]

- Appear as horizontal, slightly curved bones at the superior aspect of the chest.
- Provide a useful landmark **for assessing positioning and rotation on a chest X-ray.**

## Sternum

### Structure [#Sternum]

- Composed of three parts: `manubrium`, `body`, and `xiphoid process`.
- `Manubrium` articulates with the clavicles and the first pair of ribs.
- `Body` articulates with ribs 2-7.
- `Xiphoid process` is the inferior portion.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Sternum]

- Seen as a vertical shadow in the midline of the chest.
- Articulations with the ribs can often be identified.

## Vertebrae

### Structure [#Vertebrae]

- `Thoracic vertebrae (T1-T12)`: each vertebra has a body, pedicles, laminae, spinous process, transverse processes, and a vertebral foramen.
- `Intervertebral discs` are located between the vertebrae.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Vertebrae]

- `Vertebral bodies` appear as rectangular shapes along the midline of the thorax.
- `Spinous processes` appear as linear shadows extending posteriorly.
- `Pedicles` and `transverse processes` can be identified in a well-penetrated film.

## Costal Cartilages

### Structure [#CC]

- Hyaline cartilage structures connecting the anterior ends of the ribs to the sternum (true ribs) or to each other (false ribs).
- Provide elasticity to the rib cage.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#CC]

- Typically not well-visualized in younger individuals due to their cartilaginous nature.
- May become **visible in older individuals due to calcification**.

## Applied Anatomy

### Fractures

- `Rib fractures`: appear as discontinuities or sharp angulations in the normal curvature of the ribs.
- `Clavicle fractures`: typically occur in the middle third and are visible as a break or displacement.

### Pathological Conditions

- `Osteoporosis`: generalized decrease in bone density, often evident in vertebrae and ribs.
- `Metastatic Disease`: can cause lytic (destructive) or sclerotic (dense) lesions in the bony structures.
- `Costochondritis`: inflammation of the costal cartilages, often presents with localized pain and swelling, **not typically visible on X-ray**.
