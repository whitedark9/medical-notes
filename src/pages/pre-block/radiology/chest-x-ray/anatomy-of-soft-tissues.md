# Soft Tissues of the Chest on X-Ray

## Lungs

### Structure [#Lung]

- **Right Lung**: Three lobes (upper, middle, lower) separated by the horizontal and oblique fissures.
- **Left Lung**: Two lobes (upper, lower) separated by the oblique fissure.
- **Bronchi**: Main bronchi branching into secondary and tertiary bronchi.
- **Alveoli**: Small air sacs where gas exchange occurs.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Lung]

- Lungs appear as radiolucent (dark) areas due to air content.
- Vascular markings (pulmonary vessels) seen as fine, branching lines.
- Fissures sometimes visible as thin lines, particularly in the lateral view.

## Mediastinum

### Structure [#Me]

- Central compartment of the thoracic cavity between the two pleural sacs.
- Contains the heart, great vessels (aorta, venae cavae, pulmonary arteries, and veins), trachea, esophagus, thymus, and lymph nodes.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Me]

- Seen as a central opaque area.
- Borders formed by the heart, great vessels, and other structures.
- Widening can indicate pathology like aortic aneurysm, lymphadenopathy, or masses.

## Heart and Great Vessels

### Heart

- **Chambers**: Right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle.
- **Valves**: Tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, aortic.

### Great Vessels

- **Aorta**: Ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta.
- **Pulmonary Arteries**: Carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
- **Pulmonary Veins**: Carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.
- **Vena Cavae**: Superior and inferior vena cava bring deoxygenated blood to the right atrium.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#HG]

- **Heart silhouette**: visible as a central shadow, left border mainly formed by the left ventricle and part of the left atrium, right border by the right atrium.
- Aortic arch visible as a rounded structure on the left side.
- Pulmonary arteries seen as branching shadows from the heart towards the lungs.

## Diaphragm

### Structure [#Dia]

- Dome-shaped muscle separating the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
- Right dome higher than the left due to the liver.
- Has openings for the esophagus, aorta, and inferior vena cava.

### Appearance on X-Ray [#Dia]

- Seen as a smooth, curvilinear shadow at the base of the thoracic cavity.
- Right hemidiaphragm usually higher than the left.
- **Costophrenic angles**: the points where the diaphragm meets the chest wall; should be sharp and well-defined.

## Soft Tissue Structures

### Breast Shadows

- Variable depending on the size and density of the breasts.
- Can obscure parts of the lung fields, particularly the lower zones.

### Subcutaneous Fat and Muscle

- Appear as less dense areas surrounding the bony structures and overlying the chest wall.

## Applied Anatomy

### Pathologies in Soft Tissues

- `Pneumonia`: Appears as localized opacity within the lung fields, often segmental or lobar.
- `Pneumothorax`: Appears as a lack of lung markings with a visible pleural line, indicating collapsed lung.
- `Pleural Effusion`: Fluid in the pleural space, seen as blunting of the costophrenic angles and a meniscus sign.
- `Heart Failure`: Enlarged heart silhouette, pulmonary edema (bat-wing appearance), pleural effusions.
- `Tumors/Masses`: Appears as localized opacities, which may cause deviation of the mediastinal structures.
- `Aortic Aneurysm`: Widening of the mediastinum, visible aortic dilation.
