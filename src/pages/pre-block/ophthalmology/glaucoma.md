# Glaucoma

> Glaucoma causes vision loss and blindness by damaging the optic nerve, which is caused by increased eye pressre (> 21 mmHg).

> Normal Eye Pressure (Intra-ocular pressure - IOP) 11 - 21 mmHg

## Classification

1. Congenital Glaucoma
1. Primary Glaucoma
   1. Open angle glaucoma
   1. Closed (narrow) angle glaucoma
1. Secondary Glaucoma
1. Absolute Glaucoma

## Congenital Glaucoma

- Buphthalmos [^1] (Caused by aquaous fluid filling all cavities)
- Tears of descemet's membrane
- Corneal haze
- Increase anterior chamber depth
- Optic disc cupping
- Photosensitivity

[^1]: Buphthalmos - Congenital enlargement of the eye mostly bluish color, Single or both eyes, Corneal diameter 12 mm < 1 year, The wider the diameter, the poorer the prognosis

## Primary Glaucoma

![Glaucoma Types](/ophthalmology/glaucoma_types.jpg)

### Open Angle Glaucoma

#### Causes [#OAG]

- increased resistance to drainage in the trabecular meshwork, even though the drainage angle between the cornea and iris remains open
- Increase resistance → Increase fluid accumulation → Increase eye pressure (Intraocular pressure) → Damage optic nerve
- Most common type of glaucoma

#### Signs & Symptoms [#OAG]

- Gradually occurs with intermittent symptoms
- Starts with peripheral vision loss
- Optic nerve that are already damaged cannot be repaired

#### Diagnosis [#OAG]

- Asymptomatic
- Should check regular eye test in people > 40 years
- Ophthalmic exam, Field test

### Close Angle Glaucoma

![Narrow Angle Glaucoma](/ophthalmology/narrow-angle-glaucoma.jpg)

#### Causes [#CAG]

Increased production of aqueous fluid → the iris bowed forward → Make the angle between cornea and iris narrow or close → Increase fluid accumulation → Increase eye pressure (Intraocular pressure) → Damage optic nerve

#### Signs & Symptoms [#CAG]

- Acute, Severely painful (Medical emergency)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Fixed and dilated pupil
- Red eye
- Rainbow-colored circles around bright light
- Blurry vision or Loss of vision
- Can be triggered by dilating drops
- Reduce eye pressure within hours or can cause permanent vision loss
- Normal eye sight is regained if corrected immediately

#### Risk Factors [#CAG]

- Reading in darkness
- Hyperopia
- Old age (shallow anterior chamber)
- Sex - 3 : 1 ratio of Feamle to Male
- Race - Asian, Inuit

## Secondary Glaucoma

- Drugs such as steroid eye drops (dexamethasone) for long term (> 1 week)
- Trauma that results defects in normal eye anatomy
- Mature uveitis (အတွင်းတိမ်)
- Diabetes Mellitus (Diabetes Retinopathy)

## Treatment

### Medical

- Beta blockers (Timolol)
- Carbonic anhydraze inhibitors (Azopt and Trusopt)
- Sympathomimetics (Propine and Apraclonidine)
- Parasympathomimetics (pilocarpine)
- Prostaglandin Derivatives (Xalatan)

### Laser

- `Trabeculopalsty` (To lower eye pressure in open angle glaucoma, close angle glaucoma)
- `Sclerostomy` (To correct sclera defects caused by glaucoma)
- `Cycloablation`/`Cyclodestruction` (To decrease intraocular pressure, destroy the ciliary body that produces aqueous humor)

### Surgical

- Goniotomy (Congenital Glaucoma)
- Trabeculotomy (Congenital Glaucoma)
- Trabeculectomy (Adult glaucoma)
- Implants (Difficult non responsive)
