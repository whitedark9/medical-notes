## Eyelid

### Chalazion

> Chronic, sterile, granulomatous inflammation of a meibomian gland in the eyelid

- Painless
- No infection (sterile)
- Slow-growing lump
- Firm, non-tender, well-defined
- **Treatment**: Warm compress, Steroid, Surgery (Incision & Curettage)

### Stye (Hordeolum)

> Acute, localized infection or inflammation of the eyelid

- Zeis or Moll glands involvement >> External stye
- Meibomian glands involvement >> Internal stye
- Painful
- Infection present (most common organism - _Stap. aureus_)
- Tenderness, swelling, redness
- **Treatment**: Warm compress, Antibiotics, Surgery (Incision & Drainage)

## Cornea

- Transparent
- Avascular (No blood vessel)
- Has 5 layers: Epithelium, Bowman's Layer, Stroma, Descemet's Membrane, Endothelium
- 70 % of eye's total refractive power
- Nerve supply: the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial nerve)
- Sensitivity to touch, pain and temperature

### Corneal Ulcers

- Usually caused by infection
- No steroid is given because steroid worsen infection and high risk of perforation

## Anterior Chamber

## Lens

### Cataract

> Clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to blurred vision

- Main cause: Aging
- Symptoms: Blurry vision, Seeing halos around lights, Faded colors, Increased sensitivity to glare
- Secondary glaucoma if cataract is left untreated
- Management: ICCE, ECCE, Phacoemulsification with IOL implants

## Retina

### Hypertensive Retinopathy

> Damage to blood vessls in the retina due to high blood pressure

- Cotton-wool spots
- Macular edema
- Flame-shaped haemorrhage

### Diabetic Retinopathy

> Damage to blood vessls in the retina due to uncontrolled blood glucose level

- Cotton-wool spots
- Macular edema (major cause of blindness)
- Microaneurysms
- Neovascularization (new vessel formation)
- Retinal haemorrhage

## Optic Nerve

> Optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve) transmits visual information from the retina to the brain

![Optic Nerve](/eye/optic-nerve.png)

- transmit visual signals from the retina to the visual cortex

### Field Defect

> Loss of a portion of the visual field due to damage or dysfunction of the optic nerve

![Optic Nerve Field Defect](/eye/field-defect.jpg)

#### Types of Field Defects

1. `Central scotoma`: Loss of central vision
1. `Arcuate scotoma`: Arc-shaped loss of vision following the retinal nerve fiber layer pattern
1. `Altitudinal defect`: Loss of upper or lower half of the visual field
1. `Hemianopia`: Loss of half of the visual field
   1. `Homonymous hemianopia`: Loss of the same half of the visual field in both eyes
   1. `Heteronymous hemianopia`: Loss of different halves of the visual field in each eye (e.g. bitempral or binasal)
1. `Nasal step`: Loss of vision adjacent to the nasal horizontal midline
1. `Quadrantanopia`: Loss of vision in one-quarter of the visual field
   1. `Superior quadrantanopia`: Loss of vision in the upper quarter of the visual field
   1. `Inferior quadrantanopia`: Loss of vision in the lower quarter of the visual field
1. `Enlarged blind spot`: Increase in size of the normal blind spot in the visual field
1. `Tunnel vision`: Loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision

## Lacrimal gland

> Tear-producing gland located in the upper outer region of the orbit.

- Produce watery (aqueous) layer of the tear film that lubricate the eye

### Dacryoadenitis

- inflammation of the lacrimal gland
- **Management**: Antibiotic, Corticosteroid

### Dry Eye Syndrome

- insufficient tear production or excessive tear evaporation
- **Management**: Artificial tears

## Canaliculus

> Small ducts in both upper and lower eyelids that carry tears from the eye's surface to the lacrimal sac through the nasolacrimal duct

### Canaliculitis

- Inflammation or infection of the canaliculi
- **Management**: Warm compress, Antibiotics, Remove foreign bodies

### Canalicular Obstruction

- Blockage preventing tear drainage
- Congenital, Trauma, Tumors, Chronic inflammation
- **Management**: Conservative (Dilation, Irrigation), Surgery

## Proptosis (Exophthalmos)

> Abnormal protrusion of one or both eyeballs from the orbit

### Causes

1. Thyroid eye disease (Graves' Ophthalmopathy)
   - Most common cause
1. Orbital Tumors
   - Benign or malignant (e.g. meningioma, lymphoma)
   - Retinal blastoma
1. Inflammatory Conditions
   - Orbital cellulitis
1. Vascular Disorders
   - Carotid-cavernous fistula
   - Orbital varices
1. Trauma
1. Congenital
   - Craniofacial anomalies
1. Others
   - Sarcoidosis
   - Amyloidosis

## Refractive Erros

### Myopia (Nearsightedness)

- Clear vision for close objects, Blurred vision for distant objects
- Eye is too long, or cornea is too curved
- Cause light to focus in front of the retina
- **Correction**: Concave lens (minus lenses)
- LASIK (Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis): Reshapes the cornea

### Hyperopia (Farsightedness)

- Clear vision for distant objects, Blurred vision for close objects
- Eye is too short, or cornea is too flat
- Cause light to focus behind the retina
- **Correction**: Convex lens (plus lenses)
- LASIK

### Astigmatism

- Blur vision at all distances due to irregular curvature of the cornea or lens
- Uneven refraction of light entering the eye
- **Correction**: Cylindrical lenses
- LASIK

### Presbyopia

- Age-related loss of near vision (around 40)
- Decrease elasticity of the lens
- **Correction**: Bifocal, trifocal or progressive lens, or reading glasses

## Lazy Eye (Amblyopia)

> Vision development disorder where an eye fails to achieve normal visual acuity, even with prescription glasses or contact lenses, due to the brain and the affected eye not working together properly

1. Strabismic Amblyopia
1. Refractive Amblyopia
1. Deprivation Amblyopia

### Management

- **Patching**: Cover the stronger eye to force the brain to use the weaker eye
- **Atropine Drops**: Used in the stronger eye to temporarily blur vision
- **Vision Therapy**: Exercise and activities to imporve visual skills
- Surgery
