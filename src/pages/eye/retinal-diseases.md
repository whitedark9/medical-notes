## Anatomy of Retina

Retina has 10 layers.

1. Retinal Pigment Epithelium
1. Photoreceptor Layer

   - Contain Rods and Cones
   - Rods: Peripheral vision, Highly sensitive to low light
   - Cones: Color vision, High spatial acuity, Concentrated in the fovea

1. Outer Limiting Membrance
1. Outer Nuclear Layer
1. Outer Plexiform Layer
1. Inner Nuclear Layer
1. Inner Plexiform Layer
1. Ganglion Cell Layer
1. Nerve Fiber Layer
1. Inner Limiting Membrane

### Macula

- Central area of the retina
- High concentration of cones
- **Fovea**: Central pit within the macula, Highest visual acuity, Only cones present

---

### Blood Supply

#### Arteries

1. Central Retinal Artery (CRA)

   - Branch of the opthalmic arter (which is a branch of the internal carotid artery)
   - Supply the inner two-thirds of the retina

1. Cilioretinal Artery

   - Present in 15-50% of individual
   - Supply a portion of the macula

1. Chorroidal Circulation

   - Supply the outer third of the retina

#### Veins

1. Central Retinal Vein (CRV)

   - Runs alongside the central retinal artery
   - Collect blood from the retinal capillaries
   - Drain into the superior ophthalmic vein or directly into the cavernous sinus

1. Vortex Veins

   - Drain the choroid
   - Drain into the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins

### Blood Supply Occlusion

#### Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)

- Blockage of central retinal artery >> Ischemia of the inner retina
- **Symptoms**: Sudden, painless vision loss
- **Findings**: Pale retina with a cherry-red spot at the fovea
- **Management**: Ocular massage, hyperbaric oxygen, anterior chamber paracentesis [^1]

[^1]: anterior chamber paracentesis - an invasive procedure that involves sampling the aqueous humor

#### Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO)

- Blockage of central retinal vein >> blood accumulation and retinal haemorrhapes
- **Symptoms**: Sudden vision loss, blurred vision
- **Findings**: Retinal hamorrhages, dilated tortuous veins, cotton-wool spots
- **Management**: Anti-VEGF injections [^2], corticosteroids, laser photocoagulation

[^2]: Anti-VEGF - Medications that inhibit Vascular Endothelium Growth Factor (Bevacizumab, Ranibizumab)

### Diabetic Retinopathy

> Chronic hyperglycaemia damages retinal blood vessels

- Diabetes Type 1 - 40%
- Diabetes Type 2 - 20%

#### Stages [#DR]

- Non-proliferative: Microaneurysms, retinal haemorrhages
- Proliferative: Neovascularization [^3], risk of retinal detachment

#### Symptoms [#DR]

- Blurred vision
- Dark spots
- Vision loss

#### Risk factors [#DR]

- Duration of diabetes: 10 years - 50% risk, 30 years - 90% risk
- Poor glycaemic control

#### Management [#DR]

- Blood sugar control
- Laser photocoagulation
- Anti-VEGF injections

[^3]: Neovascularization - Formation of new blood vessels

---

### Retina Detachment

#### Type [#RD]

- Rhegmatogenous: Tear or break in the retina
- Tractional: Scar tissue pulling on the retina
- Exudative: Fluid accumulation under the retina

#### Symptoms [#RD]

- Sudden flashes of light
- Floaters
- Shadow over vision

#### Risk Factors [#RD]

- Previous eye surgery
- High myopia
- Trauma

#### Management [#RD]

- Surgical Repair (laser, cryotherapy, pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, vitrectomy)

---

### Macular Degeneration

#### Types [#MD]

- **Dry (atrophic)**: Gradual thinning of the macula
- **Wet (exudative)**: Abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina

#### Symptoms [#MD]

- Blurred or reduced central vision
- Difficulty recognizing faces

#### Risk Factors [#MD]

- Age, smoking, family history

#### Management [#MD]

- **Dry**: Anti-oxidant vitamins, healthy diet
- **Wet**: Anti-VEGF injections, laser therapy

---

### Retinitis Pigmentosa

> Genetic disorder causing rod photoreceptor degeneration

#### Symptoms [#RP]

- Night blindness
- Peripheral vision loss
- Tunnel vision

#### Risk Factors [#RP]

- Family history
- Genetic mutations

#### Management [#RP]

- No cure
- Supportive care, Vitamin A
- Retinal implants

---

### Uveitis

> Inflammation of the uveal tract [^4], affecting the retina

[^4]: Uveal tract: iris, ciliary body and choroid

#### Symptoms [#U]

- Red eye
- Photophobia
- Pain
- Blurred vision

#### Risk Factors [#U]

- Autoimmune diseases
- Infections
- Trauma

#### Management [#U]

- Corticosteroids
- Immunosuppressants
- Treatment of underlying causes
