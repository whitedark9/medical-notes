# Anatomy of Eye

## Outside the Eyeball

![Eye Muscles](/eye/eye-muscles.webp)

- The eye sits in a protective bony socket called `the orbit`
- [Six extraoccular muscles](/medicine/cns#oculomotor-nerve) in the orbit are attached to the white part of the eye called `the sclera`. They move the eye up and down, side to side, and rotate the eye.

## Surface of the Eye

- The surface of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids are covered with a clear membrane called `conjunctiva`.
- Tears lubricate the eye and are made up of three layers - mucous layer, watery layer and oil layer. These three layers together are called `tear film`.
- Mucous layer is made by the conjunctiva.
- Watery part is made by the `lacrimal gland`, located under the outside edge of the eyebrow in the orbit.
- Oil layer is made by the `meibomian gland`.
- Tears drain from the eye through the tear duct.

## Front of the Eye

![Front of the Eye](/eye/anatomy.webp)

- Light enters the eye through the clear, dome-shaped front portion of the eye called the `cornea`.
- Behind the cornea is a fluid-filled space called the `anterior chamber`. The fluid is called `aqueous humor`. To maintain a constant eye pressure, aqueous humor drains from the eye in an area called the `drainage angle`.

- Behind the anterior chamber is `iris`, the colored part of the eye and, `pupil`, the dark hole in the middle. Muscles in the iris dilate or constrict the pupil to control the amount of light reaching the back of the eye, `retina`.

- Directly behind the pupil is the `lens`. Lens change shape to focus on the object. The lens is surrounded by the `anterior and posterior lens capsules`. Small fibers called `zonules` are attached to the capsule holding the lens, suspending it from the wall.

## Back of the Eye

![Photoreceptors](/eye/photoreceptors.webp)

- The `vitreous cavity`, filled with a jellylike substance called `vitreous humor`, lies between the lens and the back of the eye.
- Light focused by the cornea and lens passes through the vitreous onto the `retina`, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye.
- A tiny but very specialized area of the retina called the `macula` is responsible for giving us our detailed, central vision. The other part of the retina, the `peripheral retina` provides us with our peripheral vision.
- Retina has two types of photoreceptors: `rods` and `cones`. Rods perceive black and white, and enable night vision. Cones perceive color and provide central vision.
- Retina sends light as electrical impulses through `optic nerve` to the visual cortex of the brain.

## Parts of the Eye

### Choroid

- Layer containing blood vessels that lines the back of the eye
- Located between the retina (the inner light-sensitive layer) and the sclera (the outer white eye wall)

### Ciliary Body

- Structure containing muscle
- Located behind the iris, which focuses the lens

### Cornea

- Clear front window of the eye which transmits and focuses (i.e., sharpness or clarity) light into the eye
- Corrective laser surgery reshapes the cornea, changing the focus.

### Fovea

- The center of the macula which provides the sharp vision

### Iris

- The colored part of the eye which helps regulate the amount of light entering the eye
- When there is bright light, the iris closes the pupil to let in less light
- When there is low light, the iris opens up the pupil to let in more light

### Lens

- Focuses light rays onto the retina
- The lens is transparent
- Can be replaced
- Lens deteriorate as we age (Catarat)

### Macula

- The area in the retina that contains special light-sensitive cells
- Light-sensitive cells allow us to see fine details clearly in the center of our visual field
- Macula deteriorate as we age (Age Related Macular Degeneration or ARMD)

### Optic Nerve

- A bundle of > 1 million nerve fibers carrying visual messages from the retina to the visual cortex of the brain.
- `Glacoma` is one of the most common eye conditions related to optic nerve damage

### Pupil

- The dark center opening in the middle of the iris
- Pupil changes size to adjust for the amount of light available
- Similar to aparture in camera

### Retina

- The nerve layer lining the back of the eye
- Retina senses light and creates electrical impulses that are sent through optic nerve to the brain

### Sclera

- The white outer coat of the eye surrounding the iris

### Vitreous Humor

- Clear gelatinous substance filling the central cavity of the eye
