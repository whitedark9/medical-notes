# Corneal Diseases

## Anatomy

- Cornea is the clear front surface of the eye, lies directly in front of the iris and pupil.
- Horizontal diameter (viewed from the front) - about 12 mm
- Vertical diameter (viewd from the front) - about 11 mm
- Cornea appears slightly wider because sclera overlaps the top and bottom of the anterior cornea
- When viewed from behind, cornea is circular, with a uniform diameter of ~11.7 mm.
- **Function** - cornea provides 65 to 75 percent of the focusing power of the eye
- Allow light to enter the eye

### Layers of Cornea

Cornea has 5 layers, from front to back,

#### The Corneal Epithelium

- 5 - 7 cells thick
- Epithelium is constantly being produced and sloughed off in the tear layer of the surface of the eye
- Last about one week
- **Function** - Provide an optimal surface for the tear film to spread across the surface of the eye

#### Bowman's layer

- Very thin (8 - 14 microns)
- Dense fibrous sheet of connective tissue
- **Function** - Help prevent corneal scratches from penetrating into the corneal stroma
- Corneal abrasion that are limited to the outer epithelial layer are healed without scarring
- Corneal abrasion that penetrates Bowman's layer and corneal stroma leave permanent scars that can affect vision

#### The Corneal Stroma

- Thickest middle layer (500 microns)
- Composed of strands of connective tissues, called `collagen fibrils`

#### Descemet's Membrane

- Very thin (5 microns)
- Separate the stroma from the underlying endothelial layer

#### The Corneal Endothelium

- Single cell layer
- Innermost layer and in touch with aqueous humor
- Damage to corneal endothelium can cause swelling(edema) and affect vision

## Cornea Diseases

- Most refractive errors - `nearsightedness` (အဝေးမှုန်ခြင်း), `farsightedness` (အနီးမှုန်းခြင်း), `astigmatism` (ပုံရိပ်နှစ်ထပ်မြင်ခြင်း) are due to a less-than-optimal curvature or symmetry of the cornea.
- `Presbyopia (အသက်ကြီး၍ အနီးမှုန်ခြင်း)` is due to aging change in the crystalline lens.

### Arcus Senilis (Corneal arcus)

![Arcus Senilis](/eye/arcus-senilis.jpg)

- Most common aging change in the cornea
- As people get older, a white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea
- The white ring is called `arcus senilis`
- The white ring is composed of cholesterol and related compounds
- In older individual, corneal arcus is not typically related to blood cholesterol levels
- If occurs in a person under 40, blood test should be tested for hyperlipidaemia

### Corneal Ulcer/Abrasion

- Check Red Eye

### Pterygium (မျက်သားတက်ခြင်း)

> Pterygium is a fibrous growth that starts on the sclera but can grow into the peripheral cornea

#### Signs & Symtoms [#P]

- Irritation
- May affect vision
- Difigurement

---

### Dry Eye

- Tears gland and eyelids abnomalitites >>> Dry eyes >>> Damage to corneal epithelium

#### Signs & Symtoms [#DE]

- Irritation
- May affect vision

---

### Corneal Dystrophy

- The most common corneal dystrophy is `Fuch's dystrophy`, that affects the corneal endothelium

#### Signs & Symptoms [#CD]

- Corneal swelling(edema)
- Foggy vision
- Photosensitivity

---

### Acanthamoeba Keratitis & Fungal Keratitis

- Occur mostly in contact lens wearers
- A serious infection
- Painful
- Can cause vision loss

---

### Keratoconus

- A thinning and deformation of the cornea
- Can't be corrected with regular eyeglasses or contact lens
- Can be corrected with scleral contact lens
- In severe cases, require cornea transplant

---

### Corneal Ectasia

- Similar to keratoconus
- A thinning and deformation of the cornea
- Occurs as a rare complication of LASIK (Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) or other corneal refractive surgery
