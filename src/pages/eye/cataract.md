# Cataract

> Cataract is decreased lens opacity (clouded lens).

## Anatomy of Lens

![Anatomy of Lens](/eye/cataract-surgery.jpg)

- Lens is a biconvex, avascular transparent structure supsended by zonules behind the iris
- Parts - Anterior capsule, Posterior capsule, Nucleus, Cortex

## Classification by parts

1. Anterior capsular cataract
1. Posterior capsular cataract
1. Nuclear cataract
1. Cortical cataract

## Classification by maturity

1. `Immature` (opacification present in certain area of the lens)
1. `Mature` (Opacification totally obscuring the red reflex [^1])
1. `Intumescent` (both opacification and swelling of the crystalline lens)
1. `Hypermature` (Dense, hard and pearly white lens)
1. `Morgagnian` (liquefaction of the cortex and sinking of the dense nucleus to the bottom of the capsular bag)

[^1]: red reflex - Reddish-orange reflection of light from the back of the eye, or fundus, observed when using an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope

### Congenital Cataract

- Happens before birth or during first year of life
- Genetic and metabolic disease (Down's syndrome)
- Intrauterine infection (Reubella)
- Occular anomalies (Aniridia)
- Hereditary

## Causes

- **Aging** (Common)
- Metabolic causes - Diabetes Mellitus, Hypocalcaemia, Wilson's disease
- Trauma
- Radiation exposure
- Toxic - Corticosteroid, Chlorpromazine
- Congenital

## Signs & Symptoms

- Faded colors
- Blurred or double vision (`Polypia`)
- Halos around light
- Sensitivity to glare from bright light
- Night blindness
- Blindness

## Management

> Surgery is the best and only treatment for cataract to regain normal vision.

- If left untreated >> Lazy eyes [^2] (children), Lens induced glaucoma (adult)
- If left longer without treatment >> More complication during surgery
- Remove the lens, vision is corrected with contact lens or intraocular lens (IOL) implants

[^2] Lazy Eyes (Amblyopia) - Happens in childhood, Brain cannot recognize the sight from the eye after that eye has had blurry vision or blindness for a long time

### Indication For Surgery

#### Visual function

- Visual Acuity is 6/60 (Person can only read the top letter of the Snellen chart)
- Compromised fixation in infants

#### Cataract Density

- Poor visualization of fundus
- Opacity is > 3 mm

#### Children

- In young children at visual developing age, removing cataract is urgent
- If not, lazy eyes (amblyopia) can occur
- Unilateral cataract - 6 weeks
- Bilateral cataract - 12 weeks

### IntraoCapsular Cataract Extraction with IOL (ICCE)

- The entired lens is removed using cryo probe
- This method is for subluxated cataratous lens

### ExtraCapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE)

![Cataract Surgery](/eye/cataract-surgery.jpg)

- Incision size is 8-10 mm
- Open the anterior capsule
- Nuclear expression
- Aspiration of lens cortex
- Posterior chamber IOL implants
- **Pros**: Less expensive
- **Cons**: Large wound, slow healing

### Phacoemulsification with IOL implants

- Incision size is 2.4-3 mm
- Open the anterior capsule
- Using the ultrasonic power, nucleus is fragmented and removed
- Aspiration of lens cortex
- Posterior chamber IOL implants
- **Pros**: Small wound, fast healing
- **Cons**: Very expensive

## Post-Op Management

- Steroid drops to reduce inflammation
- Antibiotic drops to treat infection

## Complication of Surgery

### During Surgery

1. Posterior capsule rupture with vitreous loss leads to

   - Updrawn pupil
   - Vitreous touch syndrome with Secondary Glaucoma
   - Uveitis
   - Chronic cystoid macular oedema
   - Retinal detachment

1. In phaco emulsification, nucleus can drop into the vitreous when posterior capsule ruptures
1. Expulsive chroidal haemorrhage (extremely rare)

### Early Post-Op

1. Wound leak
1. Hyphaema
1. Iris prolapse
1. Uveitis
1. Increase IOP
1. Bacterial endophthalmitis

### Late Post-Op

1. Chronic cystoid macular oedema
1. Retinal detachment
1. Displacement of IOL implants >> Pupillary capture/sunset syndrome
1. Posterior capsule opacity (Elschnig's pearls)
