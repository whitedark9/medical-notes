# Squint Eye (Strabismus)

> A condition where the eyes do not align properly when looking at an object.

- One eye may turn inwards, outwards, upwards, or downwards while the other eye is focused

## Types of Strabismus

![Strabismus Types](/eye/strabismus.jpeg)

- Esotropia (Inward Turning)
- Exotropia (Outward Turning)
- Hypertropia (Upward Turning)
- Hypotropia (Downward Turning)

## Causes

- **Genetic Factors**: Family history of strabismus.
- **Neuromuscular Problems**: Issues with the control of eye muscles.
- **Refractive Errors**: Uncorrected vision problems such as hyperopia -(farsightedness).
- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and others can be associated with strabismus.
- **Trauma**: Injury to the eye or head can lead to strabismus.
- **Other Factors**: Eye diseases or problems with eye development.

## Clinical Presentation

- Misalignment of Eyes
- Double Vision
- Eye Strain
- Head Positioning (Tilting or turning the head to see better)
- Loss of Depth Perception: Difficulty judging distances.
- Poor Vision in One Eye (Amblyopia or "lazy eye" can develop if one eye is not used properly.)

## Diagnosis

- Visual Acuity Test
- Ocular Motility Test
- Cover Test
- Refraction Test
- Retinal Examination

## Treatment

- Eyeglasses or Contact Lenses: Correcting refractive errors.
- Prism Lenses: Special lenses that can help reduce double vision.
- Vision Therapy: Exercises to improve eye coordination and focusing.
- Eye Patching: Covering the stronger eye to strengthen the weaker eye.
- Surgery: Adjusting the muscles around the eyes to correct alignment.

## Prognosis

- Early treatment often leads to better outcomes and can prevent complications such as amblyopia.
- Some individuals may need ongoing treatment to maintain proper eye alignment and vision.

## Esotropia (Inward Turning)

### Types of Esotropia

1. **Congenital/Infantile esotropia**: Present at birth or develop within the first six months
1. **Accommodative esotropia**: Develop in farsighted (hyperopia) children due to excessive focusing effort to see clearly
1. **Non-accommodative esotropia**: Develop in children or adult, is not related to focusing effort

### Clinical features [#eso]

- **Constant or intermittent inward turning** of one or both eyes
- **Double vision**
- **Amblyopia(lazy eye)** can develop if left untreated

## Exotropia (Outward Turning)

### Types of Exotropia

1. **Congenital/Infantile exotropia**
1. **Intermittent exotropia**: Outward turning occurs intermittently, often when the patient is tired, ill or focusing at the distant object
1. **Constant exotropia**: Outward turning is always present

### Clinical Features [#exo]

- **Constant or intermittent outward turning** of one or both eyes
- **Double vision**
- **Eye strains** and headache
