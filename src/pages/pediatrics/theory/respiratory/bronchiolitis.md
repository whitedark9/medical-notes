## Management of Bronchilitis

### Investigation

- Identification of RSV (Respiratory Syncitial Virus)
  - Nasopharyngeal secretions by using fluorescent antibody test (Rapid test)
- CXR
  - Hyperinflation of the lung field due to air trapping
- Blood gas analysis
  - Lower arterial O2 and raised CO2 tension in more severe cases

### Treatment

- `Supportive`
  - Oxygen: SPO2 > 92%
  - Antipyretics: `Paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose every 4-6 hours`
  - Hydration: Fluids
  - Nutritious food
- `Antiviral drug (Ribavirin)`: May use in infants with underlying cardiopulmonary disorder or immunodeficiency
- `Antibiotics`: If suspect sceondary bacterial infection
- `Steroid`, `bronchodilator`: Controversial
- `Mechinical ventilation`: in respiratory failure
