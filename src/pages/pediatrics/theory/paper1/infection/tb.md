# Tuberculosis

> Discuss about diagnosis and outline the treatment of childhood tuberculosis? (UM2)

## History Suggestive of Childhood TB

- Age < 5 years
- Fever:
  - Lowe grade (38Â°C)
  - Evening rise in temperature
  - Loss of weight, Loss of appetite
  - Night sweating
- Cough:
  - \> 3 weeks duration
  - with blood-stained sputum
- Failure to gain weight or weight loss
- Close TB contact
- Previous TB treatment
- Low immune status:
  - HIV infection
  - Immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids
  - Severe malnutrition
  - Illness
- no BCG vaccination
- Poor ventilation and overcrowded

## Physical Examination Suggestive of Childhood TB

### Pulmonary Tuberculosis

- Signs of persistent pneumonia after full course of appropriate antibiotics

### Extra-pulmonary Tuberculosis

- **Highly suggestive**:
  - Pleural effusion
  - Acute vertebral gibbus
  - Non-painful glands with draining sinus
- **Suggestive**:
  - Meningitis not responding to antibiotics
  - Pericardial effusion
  - Swollen non-painful joints
  - Non-painful enlarged lymph glands present for > 2 weeks with no known local cause and not responding to usual antibiotics
  - Distended abdomen with ascites
  - Clinical features indicative of Tuberculin hypersensitivity (e.g., erythema nodosum, phlyctenular conjunctivitis)

## Investigation

### 1. Sputum examination

- Early morning sputum examination for children > 8 years

### 2. Gastric lavage (aspiration)

- For children < 5 years
- Should do after 4 hours of not eating or drinking

### 3. Radiology

- No specific radiological signs exit for TB.
- Follwing features plus clinical features assist diagnosis.
  1. Unequivocal hilar lymph gland enlargement with or without parenchymal opacification
  2. Miliary mottling (especially in HIV-uninfected children)
  3. Large pleural effusion (> 1/3 of pleural cavity) in children > 5 years
  4. Apical opacification with cavitation (very rare in children; common in adult)

### 4. Tuberculin skin test (TST)

- Useful for diagnosis of TB
- Negative TST does not rule out TB

### 5. Tests for Extrapulmonary TB

| Disease                     | Special Investigation                          |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Cervical/other lymph glands | Biopsy/ Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) |
| TB Meningitis               | Lumbar puncture, CT brain scan                 |
| TB Arthritis                | Aspiration, Biopsy                             |
| TB Abdomen/ascites          | Ultrasound, Aspiration                         |
| TB Vertebra                 | Vertebral X-ray                                |

## Treatment

### Recommended Treatment Regimens

Two phases:

1. **Intensive phase**: To rapidly eliminate the majority of organisms and to prevent the emergence of drug resistance
2. **Continuation phase**: To eradicate the dormant organisms.
