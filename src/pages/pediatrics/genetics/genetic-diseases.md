## Chromosomal Abnormalities

### Characteristic of Single Gene Defects

### Autosomal Dominant Inheritance

> One copy of a dominant allele from either parent is sufficient to cause the disease

- Both sexes are equally affected.
- Heterozygotes are phenotypically affected. (No carrier condition)
- Genetically less severe than autosomal recessive
- Risk remains the same for each successive pregnancy
- High new mutation rate
- Variable expressivity (different symptoms) and penetrance (different ways of showing symptoms)
- e.g. `Marfan syndrome`, `Huntington's diesease`, `Otosclerosis`, `Achondroplasia`

#### Inheritance Pattern [#ADI]

- When one parent is affected (**Aa**) and the other is unaffected (**aa**)
  - **Aa**: 50% (Affected)
  - **aa**: 50% (Unaffected)

|                           | **A** (Affected Parent) | **a** (Affected Parent) |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **a** (Unaffected Parent) | **Aa** (Affected)       | **aa** (Unaffected)     |
| **a** (Unaffected Parent) | **Aa** (Affected)       | **aa** (Unaffected)     |

- When both parents are affected (**Aa**),
  - **AA**: 25% (Affected, Severe or lethal)
  - **Aa**: 50% (Affected)
  - **aa**: 25% (Unaffected)

|                           | **A** (Affected Parent 1) | **a** (Affected Parent 1) |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------ |

### Autosomal Recessive Inheritance

- Both sexes are equally affected.
- Heterozygotes are phenotypically unaffected. They are carriers.
- Less variable expressivity than autosomal dominant
- e.g. `Thalassaemia`, `Congenital adrenal hyperplasia`, `Cystic fibrosis`, `Sickle cell anaemia`

### X-linked Dominant Inheritance

> Mutation in genes on the X chromosome. Unlike X-linked recessive, one copy of mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder

- Affect both sexes
- Female have milder symptoms (because of normal gene on the second X chromosome)
- Affected fathers pass the disorder to all daughters but none of their sons
- Affected mothers pass the disorder to both sons and daughters with 50% chance
- e.g. `Vitamin-D resistant rickets`, `Fragile X Syndrome`, `Rett Syndrome`

#### Inheritance Pattern [#XLD]

- When father is unaffected (**XY**) and mother is affected (**XH**),
  - **XX**: 25% (Unaffected Daughter)
  - **XH**: 25% (Affected Daughter)
  - **XY**: 25% (Unaffected Son)
  - **HY**: 25% (Affected Son)

### X-linked Recessive Inheritance

> Mutation in genes on the X chromosome (Sex chromosome)

- Males (**XY**) are affected (they have a single X chromosome)
- Females (**XX**) are carriers (the second X chromosome compensates the defective one)
- No male-to-male transmission (affected male cannot pass the disorders to their sons, because the sons receive **Y** from their fathers)
- Affected male can have only normal sons and carrier daughters (daughter receive defective **X** from their fathers)
- e.g. `Haemophilia`, `Red-Green Color Blindness`, `G6PD deficiency`

#### Inheritence Pattern [#XLR]

- When father is unaffected (**XY**) and mother is carrier (**XH**),
  - **XX**: 25% (Unaffected Daughter)
  - **XH**: 25% (Carrier Daughter)

## Multifactorial Inheritance

> Multi-factorial inheritance disorders are caused by the combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors.

Factors which increase the risks to relatives are:

- **More sever forms of disorder** (e.g. the risk of recurrence to siblings is greater in bilateral cleft lip and palate than in unilateral cleft lip alone)
- **Close relation to the affected person** (e.g. the risk to siblings is greater than to distant relatives)
- **Multiple affected family members** (e.g. the more siblings already affected, the greater the risk of recurrence)
- **Sex difference in prevlaence** (e.g. In Hirschsprung's disease, male to feamle rate is 3:1; In SLE, female to male is 3:1)

When an affected female has greater genetic predisposition than an affected male, the risk to siblings is also greater.
