### Investigation

- Serum calcium level - ~~low or normal~~ (normal 9-11 mgg/100ml)
- Serum phosphorus level - ~~low~~ (< 4mg/dl)
- Serum alkaline phosphatase level - **high** (normal 250-800 IU/L for growing child)
- **Roentgenographic changes**
  - Cupping, fraying and widening of distal end of the bone
  - Increase distance between epiphysis and diaphysis
  - Raised periosteum and double contour along the shaft
  - Reduced bone density with prominent trabeculae
  - Delayed bone maturation
  - Healing state - Zone of preparatory calcification

### Management

For treatment,

- **IM vitamin D 600,000 IU stat** and **oral vitamin D 400 IU daily** after the process of healing has started

For prevention,

- Exposure to sunlight
