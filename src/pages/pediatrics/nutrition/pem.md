# Severe Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)

According to WHO criteria:

> Presence of severe wasting (< 70% weight for height or - 3SD) and/or bilateral edema

## Types of PEM by Wellcome Classification

1. **60 - 80% of standard weight for age**
   - without edema - underweight
   - with edema - `Kwashiorkor`
1. **< 60% of standard weight for age**
   - without edema - `Marasmus`
   - with edema - `Marasmic-Kwashiorkor`

## Clinical Features of PEM

### Kwashiorkor

#### Four Cardinal Criteria

1. Generalized pitting `edema`
1. `Muscle wasting` with some retention of subcutaneous fat
1. `Psychological changes`: Apathetic, Miserable, Irritable
1. `Growth retardation` (60 - 80% of weight for age)

#### Other Features of Kwashiorkor

1. Skin changes

   - Hyperpigmentation
   - Hypopigmentation
   - Crazy pavement dermatosis
   - Fissures and blisters
   - Desquamation and ulceration

1. Hair changes

   - Thin, dry, silky and depigmented areas of pigmented and depigmented segments (Flag sign)

1. Enlarged liver
1. Haematological changes

   - Iron deficiency anaemia, Folic acid deficiency

1. Signs and symptoms of vitamin deficiencies

### Marasmus

#### Characteristic Features [#marasmus]

- Muscle wasting
- Loss of subcutaneous fat
- Growth retardation (< 60% of weight for age)

#### Other Features of Marasmus

- Old man facies
- Hungry looking, listless, anxious, sleep very poorly
- Mucus diarrhoea (Hunger diarrhoea)

### Marasmic-Kwashiorkor

#### Characteristic Features [#marasmic-kwashiorkor]

- Muscle wasting
- Loss of subcutaneous fat
- Growth retardation (< 60% of weight for age)
- Oedema

## Causes of PEM

### Inadequate or Improper Food Intake Quantitatively or Qualitatively

- Low socio-economic condition
- Factors for reduced intake
  - Infection and infestation
  - Emotional factors
  - Lack of nutritional education
  - Inappropriate weaning and improper feeding practices

## Common Complications of PEM

- Hypoglycaemia
- Hypothermia
- Severe dehydration and hypovolaemic shock
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Anaemic heart disease
- Septicaemia
- Growth retardation and intellectual disablility
