# Infective Endocarditis

> An infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, typically involving the heart valves, characterized by the formation of vegetations composed of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms on the valve leaflets

## Common Causal Organisms

1. _Streptococcus viridan group_ (leading cause in child)
1. _Staphylococcus aureus_ (leading cause in child)
1. _Streptococcus fecalis_ (enterococcus)

## Pathophysiology

### Endothelial Damage

- **Damage to endothelium of heart valves or endocardium of heart** >>> Exposure of underlying layers >>> Platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition at the site of injury >>> Formation of sterile (non-bacterial) thrombotic vegetation >>> A place for bacterial colonization >>> Bacteria causes more growth of vegetation >>> Dense layer of fibrin and platelet protects the bacteria from host immune system and antibiotic penetration >>> Inflammation of the heart valve
- Pieces of vegetation can break off and embolize distant organs (`Cerebral emboli`, `Pulmonary emboli`, `Systemic emboli`)
- Presence of bacteria in the bloodstream >>> Formation of circulating immune complexes >>> Depsition of immune complexes in other tissues (`Glomerulonephritis`, `Vasculitis lesion`)
- Damage to heart valves >>> Acute or chronic valvular insufficiency >>> `Heart failure`
- Presence of bacteria toxins and cytokines in the bloodstream >>> `Fever`, `Chills & Rigor`, `Night sweats`, `Malaise`
- Spread of bacteria into other organs >>> `Secondary infection` (Osteomyelitis, Septic arthritis, Psoas abscess)
