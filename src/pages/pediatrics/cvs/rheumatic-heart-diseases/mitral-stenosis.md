# Mitral Stenosis

## Clinical Features [#ms]

Clinical features depends on the severity of obstruction

### Mild

- No symptoms initially

### Severe

- Exercise intolerance and dyspnoea
- Orthopnoea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND)
- Cardiomegaly
- Haemoptysis
- Hepatomegaly, Ascites, Oedema (due to pulmonary hypertension and RVH)
- Apical impulse is tapping
- Left parasternal heave or epigastric pulsation (RVH)
- Loud S1, opening snap, MDM with presystolic accentuation at the apex, long, low pitched
- Loud pulmonary 2nd sound (if pulmonary hypertension is present)

## Investigation [#ms]

### Severe MS

#### CXR

- Heart:
  - Mitralization - straightening of left heart border
  - Left atrial enlargement
  - Prominent pulmonary artery and prominent right-sided heart chambers
- Lungs:
  - Greater perfusion in upper lobes
  - Kerley B lines (horizontal, at costophrenic angle)
  - Bat's wing hilum (alveolar oedema)
  - Pulmonary hypertension - prominent pulmonary conus, translucent peripheral lung fields

#### ECG

- LAH, RVH, RAD

#### Echocardiogram

- Shows distinct narrowing of themitral orifice during diastole
- LA enlargement and RVH/enlargement

## Treatment

### Medical

1. Early detection, prompt and adequate treatment of infection
1. Medical treatment of heart failure if present
1. Treatment of carditis if present
1. Prevention of rheumatic fever (secondary prevention)
1. Prevention of infective endocarditis (tertiary prevention)

### Surgical

- MV replacement is avoided unless absolutely necessary
- Mitral valvotomy or balloon catheter mitral valvuloplasty

#### Indications

- Symptomatic, stenosis, pliable, non-calcified valves without atrial arrhythmia or thrombi
