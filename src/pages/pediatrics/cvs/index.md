# Cardiovascular System

## Heart Sounds

1. Systolic heart sounds include the 1st heart sound (S1) and clicks.
1. Diastolic heart sounds include the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th heart sounds (S2, S3, and S4), as well as knocks and snaps.
1. `S1` is a high-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `mitral and tricuspid valves` just after the beginning of systole.
1. `S2` is a low-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `aortic and pulmonary valves` at the beginning of diastole.
1. S3 is an abnormal heart sound in adults. When present, it occurs in early diastole, immediately after S2. It indicates the end of rapid ventricular filling.
1. S4 is an abnormal heart sound. When present, it occurs just before S1 at the end of diastole.

## Layers of Heart

1. `Endocardium`: Innermost layer, Contain endothelium cells
1. `Myocardium`: Middle layer, Contain thick cardiac muscles
1. `Pericardium`
   1. `Fibrous Pericardium`: Dense connective tissue
   1. `Serious Pericardium`
      1. Parietal Layer
      1. Pericardial Cavity: Space between pareital layer and visceral layers,Contain pericardial fluid
      1. Visceral Layer (`Epicardium`)
