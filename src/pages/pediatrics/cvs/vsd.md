# Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

> An opening (defect) in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing left ventricle and right ventricle. This allows oxygenated blood from the left ventricle mixed with deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle

## Pathophysiology

### Left-to-Right Shunt

> Blood flows abnormally from the left side of the heart or systemic circulation (higher pressure) to the right side of the heart or pulmonary circulation (lower pressure) through a congenital or acquired defect.

- Left ventricle has higher pressure than right ventricle
- **During systole**, blood flows from left ventricle to right ventricle through the ventricular septal defect (`Pansystolic murmur`) >>> Increase volume in right ventricle >>> Increase pulmonary circulation

### Increased Pulmonary Circulation

- Right ventricle pumps the extra blood into pulmonary arteries >>> Increase pulmonary blood flow (`Pulmonary hypertension`) >>> Increase blood returns to the left atrium via pulmonary veins

### Increase Left Atrial and Left Ventricular Filling

- **During diastole**, extra blood in the left atrium flows into the left ventricule >>> Increase blood flow through the mitral value **during systole** (low-pitched and rumbling `Mid-diastolic murmur` at the apex of the heart)

## Clinical Features

Depend on the size of the defect

### Small VSD (< 0.5-2 cm2)

#### Asymptomatics

#### Murmur

- Pansystolic murmur [^1]
- Best heard at lower left sternal border
- May radiate to right sternal border or entire precordium
- The smaller the opening, the louder the murmur
- Frequently thrill present

[^1]: Pansystolic murmur: Begin with the first heart sound (S1) and extend through the second heart sound (S2), covering the enterity of the systole

### Large VSD (> 1 cm2)

#### Symptoms

Usually present in early infant (around 6-10 weeks of age)

- Dyspnoea
- Feeding difficulties
- Poor growth
- Repeated chest infection (respiratory infection)
- Can develop `congested heart failure`

#### Signs

- Prominence of precordium (common)
- Cardiomegaly (down and out displacement of apex beat)
- Heaving apical impulse (left ventricular hypertrophy)
- `Pansystolic murmur`best heard at lower left sternal border
- Second heart sound may be increased due to pulmonary hypertension
- Thrill present
- `Mid-diastolic murmur` at the apex due to increase mitral valve flow

## Investigation

### CXR

- Small VSD: Normal heart size and normal pulmonary vascularity
- Large VSD: Gross cardiomegaly (Left ventricule + Later right ventricle), Increase pulmonary vascular markings (plethoric lung field)

### ECG

- Small VSD: Normal
- Large VSD: Left ventricular hypertrophy, Biventricular hypertrophy, Peak P-wave

### Echocardiogram

- Two dimension to detect structural defects - site, size, vegetations, chamber enlargement
- Doppler: To detect pressure gradient across defect, To visualize small defect of muscular septum

### Cardiac Catheterization

- Increase oxygen saturation and pressure in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery
- Pulmonary artery pressure is measured to calculate pulmonary blood flow and vascular resistance

## Natural Course and Complications

- Spontaneous closure (30-50%) in small defect during the first 2-4 years of life
- Congestive heart failure (CHF) [^2]
- Infective endocarditis
- Acquired infundibular pulmonary stenosis
- Pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension)
- Eisenmenger Syndrome

[^2]: CHF is a condition where heart cannot pump blood efficiently to meet the body's need, leading to a buildup of fluid (congestion) in the lungs and other tissues.

## Treatment

### Small VSD

- Reassurance
- No restriction on physical activity
- Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis
- Long term follow up until spontaneous closure occurs

### Large VSD

1. Medical treatment
   - Prevention and treatment of respiratory infections
   - Control of congestive heart failure
   - Prophylaxis of infective endocarditis
   - Nutritional support
1. Surgical treatment
   - Closure of the defect (primary repair), using Dacron patch

### Indication for Surgery

- Patient at any age with uncontrolled congestive heart failure
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Pulmonary systemic blood flow > 2 : 1

### Contraindication

- Reversed shunt (right to left)
- Severe pulmonary vascular disease

### Others

- Pulmonary palliative banding with repair
- Catheter occlusion devices are also being tested for closuring the defect
