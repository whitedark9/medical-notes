# Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)

> Communication between aorta, distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and the pulmonary at its bifurcation fails to close after birth

![PDA](/cvs/pda.jpg)

- Its closure normally occurs soon after birth
- Most common in preterm infants

## Pathophysiology

### Left-to-right Shunt

- Blood flows from the high-pressure aorta to the low-pressure pulmonary artery during **both systole and diastole** (`Continuous Machinery Murmur`) → Increase pulmonary blood flow → Increase blood return to left atrium and left ventricle

### Volume Overload

- Increase blood return to left atrium and left ventricle → Left atrium and ventricular dilation and hypertrophy (`Left ventricular hypertrophy`, `Cardiomegaly`)
- Increase blood flow to pulmonary artery → Pulmonary circulation overload and congestion (`Pulmonary congestion`) → `Increase pulmonary vascular markings` in CXR

### Wide Pulse Pressure

- **Increase systolic pressure**: Blood flow from the aorta to pulmonary artery → Increase pulmonary blood flow → Increase blood flow from pulmonary vein into left artium → More blood from left artium into left ventricle → More work for left ventricle → Increase stroke volume → Increase systolic blood pressure
- **Decrease diastolic pressure**: Blood flow from the aorta to pulmonary artery during diastole → Decrease diastolic blood pressure → `Wide pulse pressure`

## Clinical Features

### Small PDA

- May be asymptomatic
- `Continuous murmur`: Loudest at 2nd left intercostal space

### Large PDA

- Become symptomatic in early life
- Develop congestive heart failure around 6-12 weeks of age
- Effort intolerance, Palpitation and frequent chest infection in older children
- Increased pulse volume, Collapsing type (Sharp rise and abrupt fall)
- Wide pulse pressure
- Prominent carotid pulsations [^1] (Corrigans Sign)
- Precordium
  - `Cardiomegaly` (Apex beat displaced downward anf outward)
  - `Prominent heaving apical impulse` (left ventricular hypertrophy)
  - `Thrill` (usually systolic): Maximal at 2nd left intercostal space and radiate toward the left clavicle, left sternal border or apex
  - `Continuous machinery murmur (classic)`: Best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space, radiating to the left clavicle and back

[^1]: More blood in left ventricle → More forciful ejection of left ventricle during systole → Carotid pulsation with each systole

## Investigation

### Large PDA [#investigation]

#### CXR

- Cardiomegaly (Left ventricle + Later right ventricle)
- Increase pulmonary vascular markings (plethoric lung field)

![PDA](/cvs/pda-x-ray.jpeg)

#### ECG

- Left ventricular hypertrophy, Later Biventricular hypertrophy

#### Echocardiogram

- Suprasternal notch scan allows direct visualization of the ductus
- Doppler - Retrograde turbulent flow in the pulmonary artery during systole and aortic retrograde flow in diastole

#### Cardiac Catheterization

- Increase oxygen and pressure in the pulmonary artery
- The catheter can be passed from the pulmonary artery across the ductus into the descending aorta

## Complication

- Heart failure most often in early infancy (large PDA)
- Infective endocarditis
- Pulmonary/Systemic embolism [^2]
- Eisenmenger syndrome (Rare)
- Non-infective thrombosis of the ductus with embolization and paradoxical emboli [^3]
- Ductus calcification
- Ductus/Pulmonary artery aneurysm [^4]

[^2]: Vegetations from the right side of the heart or PDA can travel to the lungs, causing `pulmonary embolism`. If there is a right-to-left shunt or if the vegetations are located on the left side of the heart, emboli can enter the systemic circulation, causing `systemic embolism`.
[^3]: Paradoxical emboli occurs when a thrombus (blood clot) travels from the venous system to the arterial system (through ductus)
[^4]: Abnormal dilation of pulmonary artery

## Treatment

### Medical Treatment

- In preterm infants
  - No symptoms - wait for spontaneous closure
  - Symptomatic preterm infants - `IV indomethacin 0.1 mg/kg/day for 3 doses`
- Prevention and treatment of `respiratory infection`
- Control of `congestive heart failure`
- Prevention and treatment of `infective endocarditis`
- Nutritional support

### Surgical Treatment

- Indications
  - As soon as diagonsis is made (at any age)
- Method
  - Surgical closure (ligation and division of the ductus by a standard left thoracotomy)
  - Transcatheter closure using umbrella-like devices
