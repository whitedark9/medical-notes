# Tetralogy of Fallot

> **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)** : A hole between the right and left ventricles

> **Overriding Aorta**: The aorta is positioned directly over the VSD, receiving blood from both the right and left ventricles

> **Pulmonary Stenosis**: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract

> **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy**: Thickening of the right ventricular muscle due to increased workload from pumping blood through the narrow pulmonary valve

## Pathophysiology

- Right to left shunt through the VSD due to higher resistance caused by pulmonary stenosis ([Left to right shunt](/pediatrics/cvs/vsd#left-to-right-shunt))
- **Result**: Mixed oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are pumped into systemic circulation >>> **Low oxygen signs and symptoms**

## Clinical Features

### Cyanosis

- Bluish discoloration of the lips, mouth and nail beds (due to low oxygen)
- Occur later in the 1st year of life

### Paroxysmal Hypercyanotic Attacks / Blue Spells

- Crying, dyspnoeic, restless, worse cyanosis, convulsion and loss of consciousness (severe cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting)
- Occur during the first two years of life
- Occur after waking up or exertion

### Dyspnoea

- Shortness of breath
- Occur on exertion
- Young children play for a short time and then sit or lie down
- Older children rest in a squatting position for the relief of dyspnoea

### Clubbing

- Bulbous swelling of the fingers and toes (due to chronic hypoxia)

## Examination

1. `Growth retardation` (due to chronic hypoxia and inadequate nutrition)
1. `Central cyanosis`
1. `Clubbing`
1. Older children may have `dusky blue skin`, `gray sclerae with engorged blood`
1. Pulse and arterial pulse pressure usually normal
1. Left hemithorax may bulge anteriorly (due to right ventricular hypertrophy)
1. Heart size is generally normal
1. Left parasternal heave
1. `Systolic thrill` along the left sternal border in the thrid and fourth parasternal spaces (about 50%)
1. `Ejection systolic murmur` is most intense at the upper sternal border (2nd left intercostal space)
1. Second heart sound is single or the pulmonary component is soft

## Investigations

### CXR

- Oligaemic lung field (reduced pulmonary blood flow)
- Heart size normal
- Boot shape (concavity at the pulmonary conus and rounded titled apex)

### ECG

- Right axis deviation
- Right ventricular hypertrophy

### Echocardiogram

- Establish the diagnosis
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Over-riding aorta

### Cardiac catherization

- Morphological defect
- Systolic Pressure in right ventricle almost equal to left ventricular pressure
- Pulmonary artery pressure is markedly reduced
- Oxygen saturation depends on right to left shunt

## Treatment

### Medical Treatment

#### Hypercyanotic spells

One or more of the following in sequence

- Calming and placement of infant on the abdomen in knee-chest position
- 100% oxygen (mask)
- IV Propranolol 0.1-0.2 mg/kg and then prophylactic dose 0.5-1 mg/kg 2-3 times a day orally
- SC morphine 0.1 mg/kg (not more than 0.2 mg/kg)
- IV Sodium bicarbonate (in unusually severe spell)
- Vasopressors - IV phenylephadrine/methoxamine (If resistant to above therapy)

#### General

- Maintenance of nutrition
- Prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis
- Prevention and treatment of dehydration
  - Adequate hydration
  - Monitoring and maintenance of hematocrit around 60%

#### Extreme polycythemia and symptomatic patients

- Venesection and volume replacement with albumin or saline transfusion

### Surgical Treatment

#### Palliative

Systemic to pulmonary artery shunt

- Blalock-Taussig shunt (modified): Between subclavian artery and pulmonary artery (most commonly used)
- Waterson shunt: Between ascending aorta and right pulmonary artery
- Potts: Between descending aorta and left pulmonary artery

#### Curative

Corrective open heart surgery and repair

- Relieve right ventricular outflow obstruction and closure of VSD

## Complications

1. Cerebral thrombosis and embolization
1. Brain abscess (Less common)
1. Infective endocarditis
1. Hypercyanotic attacks
1. Growth retardation
1. Iron deficiency anaemia
