# Tetralogy of Fallot

> **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)** : A hole between the right and left ventricles

> **Overriding Aorta**: The aorta is positioned directly over the VSD, receiving blood from both the right and left ventricles

> **Pulmonary Stenosis**: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract

> **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy**: Thickening of the right ventricular muscle due to increased workload from pumping blood through the narrow pulmonary valve

## Pathophysiology

- Right to left shunt through the VSD due to higher resistance caused by pulmonary stenosis ([Left to right shunt](/pediatrics/cvs/vsd#left-to-right-shunt))
- **Result**: Mixed oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are pumped into systemic circulation >>> **Low oxygen signs and symptoms**

## Clinical Features

### Cyanosis

- Bluish discoloration of the lips, mouth and nail beds (due to low oxygen)
- Occur later in the 1st year of life

### Paroxysmal Hypercyanotic Attacks / Blue Spells

- Crying, dyspnoeic, restless, worse cyanosis, convulsion and loss of consciousness (severe cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting)
- Occur during the first two years of life
- Occur after waking up or exertion

### Dyspnoea

- Shortness of breath
- Occur on exertion
- Young children play for a short time and then sit or lie down
- Older children rest in a squatting position for the relief of dyspnoea
