# Antepartum Haemorrhage

> Vaginal bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation before the onset of labour

## Severity of Bleeding

1. **Minor Bleeding**: < 50 ml
1. **Major Bleeding**: 50 - 1000 ml without clinical shock
1. **Massive Bleeding**: > 1000 ml and/or signs of clinical shock
1. **Recurrent APH**: Bleeding on more than one occasion

## Causes of APH

### Placental Causes

- Placental abruption
- Placenta praevia

### Fetal Cause

- Vasa praevia

### Maternal Cause

- Vaginal trauma
- Cervical ectropion
- Cervical carcinoma
- Vaginal infection and cervicitis

### Indeterminate Cause

## Procedures of APH

- **APH must always be taken seriously**
- When the cause is unexplained, there remains **increase risk of fetal growth restriction**.

### History

- How much bleeding?
- Triggering factors (e.g. postcoital bleeding)
- Associated with pain or contractions?
- Is the baby moving?
- Last cervical smear (date, normal or abnormal)

### Examination

- Pulse, Blood pressure
- Is the uterus soft or tender and firm?
- Fetal heart auscultation/CTG (Cardiotocography)
- Speculum vaginal examination, preferably with ultrasound to visualize the cervix

### Investigations

- Depending on the degree of bleeding, full blood count, clotting, if suspected praevia/abruption, cross-match 6 units of blood
- Ultrasound (fetal size, presentation, amniotic fluid, placental position and morphology)

## Complications of APH

### Maternal complications

1. Anaemia
1. Infection
1. Maternal shock
1. Renal tubular necrosis
1. Consumptive coagulopathy
1. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)
1. Prolonged hospital stay
1. Psychological sequelae
1. Complications of blood transfusion

### Fetal complications

1. Fetal hypoxia
1. Small for gestational age and fetal growth restriction
1. Prematurity (iatrogenic and spontaneous)
1. Fetal death

## Placenta Praevia

> Placenta implants low in the uterus, covering the cervical os [^1]

- May be associated with bleeding, provoked or spontaneous
- Bleeding is from the maternal, not featal circulation

### Classification

- **Major**: placenta within 2 cm from the internal os
- **Minor**: placenta beyond 2 cm from the internal os

[^1]: cervical os: the opening in the cervix at each end of the endocervical canal

### Clinical Presentation [#PP]

- **Painless Vaginal Bleeding (in 3rd trimester)**: Bright red color
- **Bleeding**: Often occur without warning, may be recurrent, increase in frequency and volume as the pregnancy progresses

### Warning Signs [#PP]

- Low-lying placenta at 20 week anomaly scan
- Painless vaginal bleeding
- Signs of Shock - Maternal collapse, Feeling cold, Light-headedenss, Restlessness, Distress, Panic

### Risk Factors [#PP]

- Previous uterine surgery (Curettage [^2], Submucous myomectomy [^3])
- Previous cesarean section
- Previous placenta praevia
- Multiple gestations
- Smoking
- Assisted conception
- Uterine structural abnormality (e.g. septum, fundal myoma)

[^2]: Curettage: A surgical cleaning or scraping of a body part (as the uterus)
[^3]: Myomectomy: Removal of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)

### Prevention [#PP]

- Avoid risk factors: Unnecssary caesarean section, smoking
- Early identification: Ultrasound in 2nd trimester to locate the placenta

### On Abdominal Examination [#PP]

- Size of uterus is proportionate to the period of gestation
- Soft and relaxed uterus (No tenderness)
- May associate with abnormal lie, malpresentation
- High presentation part (placenta in lower segment prevents the fetus from descending)
- Irregular abdominal pain associated with uterine contraction
- **No digital vaginal examination until the cause of APH is identified by ultrasound**

### Investigation [#PP]

- **Ultrasound**: Difficult to diagnose placenta praevia until lower segment begins to form at about 28 weeks
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound**: Cold standard in the localization of a low lying placenta (allow acurate measurement of the placenta edge from the internal os)

## Placental Abruption

> Premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall.

### Clinical Presentation [#PA]

- **Painful vaginal bleeding**: Dark red in color, Bleeding may be concealed
- **Uterine tenderness**: May be accompanied by contractions.
- **Abdominal or back pain**
- **Fetal distress**: Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, Absense or reduced fetal movements
- **Shock**: Sweating, Hypotension, Tachycardia

### Warning Signs [#PA]

- Sudden onset of abdominal pain
- Painful vaginal bleeding
- Uterine tenderness and contractions
- Signs of fetal distress
- Signs of Shock - Maternal collapse, Feeling cold, Light-headedenss, Restlessness, Distress, Panic

### Risk Factors [#PA]

- Hypertension or Pre-eclampsia
- Smoking
- Cocaine use
- Previous placenta abruption
- Trauma to the maternal abdomen
- Multiple gestations
- Fetal growth restriction
- Polyhydramnios

### Prevention [#PA]

- Management of blood pressure
- Avoid trauma
- Stop smoking and cocaine use

## Vasa Praevia

> Fetal blood vessels run over or near the cervical os, unsupported by placental tissue or umbilical cord.

### Clinical Presentation [#VP]

- **Painless Vaginal Bleeding**: Especially after membrane rupture
- **Fetal distress**: Fetal bradycardia or heart rate abnormalities

### Warning Signs [#VP]

- Painless bleeding after rupture of membrane
- Sudden onset of fetal bradycardia

### Risk Factors [#VP]

- Low-lying pregnancy
- Velamentous insertion (Umblical cord inserts into the fetal membrane instead of the placenta)
- Multiple gestations

### Preventions [#VP]

- **Prenatal Ultrasound**
- **Scheduled Cesarean Section**: Planning delivery around 34-36 weeks to avoid emergency situations

## Management of APH

### Initial Management

Stabilize the mother (IV fluids, blood transfusions if necessary) and continuous fetal monitoring.

### Delivery Planning

Based on the cause, severity of bleeding, and gestational age.

#### Placenta Praevia [#Manage]

**Avoid vaginal examinations**, plan for cesarean delivery if bleeding is severe or if the placenta covers the cervical os.

#### Placental Abruption [#Manage]

Immediate delivery if there is significant maternal or fetal distress, induction of labor or cesarean section as clinically indicated.

#### Vasa Praevia [#Manage]

Elective cesarean section around 34-36 weeks, emergency cesarean if bleeding occurs.
