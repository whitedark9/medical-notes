<details>
  <summary>B. Benzodiazepine : Naloxone</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Naloxone → opioid receptor antagonist. Benzodiazepine overdose →
  treated with flumazenil.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>C. Digoxin : Beta-blocker</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Digoxin toxicity → treated with digoxin-specific antibody (Fab),
  not beta-blockers.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>D. Lead : Sodium calcium acetate</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Lead poisoning → chelation therapy with EDTA, dimercaprol, or DMSA
  → not sodium calcium acetate.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>E. Organophosphate: Praildoxime</summary>
  `True` - Organophosphate → inhibits acetylcholinesterase → pralidoxime
  reactivates enzyme.
</details>

**57. Clinical features suggestive of opiate overdose are**

<details>
  <summary>A. abdominal pain and diarrhea</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Opioids → reduce gut motility → constipation, not diarrhea.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>B. diminished rate and depth of respiration</summary>
  `True` - Opioids → act on μ-receptors in medulla → respiratory depression.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>C. hypertension</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Opiate overdose → vasodilation + histamine release → hypotension
  more likely.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>D. pinpoint pupils</summary>
  `True` - Opioids → parasympathetic stimulation via Edinger-Westphal nucleus →
  miosis (pinpoint pupils).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>E. pulmonary oedema</summary>
  `True` - Opiates → ↑ pulmonary capillary permeability + hypoxia → pulmonary
  edema in severe cases.
</details>

**58. Features of muscarinic activity in organophosphate toxicity**

<details>
  <summary>A. bronchorrhea</summary>
  `True` - OP → excess ACh at muscarinic receptors → ↑ bronchial gland secretion
  → bronchorrhea.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>B. fasciculation and paralysis</summary>
  ~~False~~ - These → nicotinic effects at neuromuscular junction, not
  muscarinic.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>C. mydriasis</summary>
  ~~False~~ - OP → muscarinic stimulation → miosis, not mydriasis.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>D. salivation</summary>
  `True` - OP → excess parasympathetic stimulation → profuse salivation.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>E. tachycardia</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Muscarinic excess → vagal stimulation → bradycardia, not
  tachycardia.
</details>

---

**59. Vitamin C deficiency**

<details>
  <summary>A. can cause poor wound healing</summary>
  `True` - Vitamin C → essential cofactor for hydroxylation of proline/lysine in
  collagen synthesis → deficiency → defective collagen → impaired wound healing.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>B. can present as Korsakoff's psychosis</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Korsakoff’s syndrome → thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, not
  vitamin C deficiency.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>C. can cause swollen gums that bleed</summary>
  `True` - Scurvy → fragile capillaries + defective connective tissue → swollen
  bleeding gums.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>D. is associated with angular stomatitis</summary>
  ~~False~~ - Angular stomatitis → riboflavin (vitamin B2) deficiency.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>E. hemarthrosis can occur</summary>
  `True` - Vitamin C deficiency → fragile capillaries → bleeding into joints
  (hemarthrosis).
</details>

---

**60. The followings are complications of parenteral nutrition**

<details>
  <summary>A. electrolyte imbalance</summary>
  `True` - PN → rapid fluid and electrolyte shifts → hypokalemia,
  hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>B. fluid overload</summary>
  `True` - Excess infusion volume → ↑ intravascular volume → fluid overload and
  pulmonary edema.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>C. hypoglycemia</summary>
  `True` - Abrupt stoppage of glucose infusion → continued insulin secretion →
  rebound hypoglycemia.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>D. hepatic steatosis</summary>
  `True` - Long-term PN → excess glucose/lipid delivery → fatty infiltration of
  liver → hepatic steatosis.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>E. refeeding syndrome</summary>
  `True` - Malnourished state → sudden feeding → insulin surge → cellular uptake
  of phosphate, potassium, magnesium → life-threatening electrolyte shifts
  (refeeding syndrome).
</details>
