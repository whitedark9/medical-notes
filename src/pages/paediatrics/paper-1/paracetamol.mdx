# Paracetamol in Paediatrics

## Mechanism of Action (MOA)

- Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme in the CNS → decreases prostaglandin synthesis → antipyretic and analgesic effects.
- Minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory action (weak inhibition of peripheral prostaglandins).

## Dosage & Route

- **Oral / Rectal**:

  - `10–15 mg/kg/dose` every 6–8 hours.
  - Maximum: `60 mg/kg/day` (not exceeding `4 g/day`).

- **Intravenous** (for children >2 years):

  - `15 mg/kg/dose` every 6 hours or `7.5 mg/kg/dose` every 4 hours.
  - Maximum: same as oral (60 mg/kg/day).

## Indications

- Antipyretic: fever (any cause).
- Analgesic: mild to moderate pain (headache, musculoskeletal pain, postoperative pain).
- Adjunct in multimodal analgesia.

## Contraindications

- Known hypersensitivity to paracetamol.
- Severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease.
- Severe renal impairment (dose adjustment required).

## Overdose

- **Toxic dose**: >150 mg/kg (single ingestion) in children.

### Pathophysiology:

- Excess dose → saturation of glucuronidation/sulfation pathways → increased metabolism via cytochrome P450 → excessive _N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)_ formation → depletion of glutathione → hepatocellular necrosis.

### Clinical features (phases):

1. 0–24 hrs: Nausea, vomiting, pallor, diaphoresis.
2. 24–72 hrs: Right upper quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, ↑ liver enzymes.
3. 72–96 hrs: Fulminant hepatic failure, jaundice, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal failure.
4. Recovery (if survives).

### Management:

- `Gastric lavage` / `activated charcoal` (if within 1 hr of ingestion).
- Antidote: `N-acetylcysteine (NAC)` → replenishes glutathione, binds NAPQI.
- Supportive: IV fluids, monitor LFTs, coagulation profile, renal function.
- Liver transplantation in fulminant hepatic failure.
