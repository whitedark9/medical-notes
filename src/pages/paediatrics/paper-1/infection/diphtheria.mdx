# Laryngeal Diphtheria

> Acute infectious disease caused by _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, characterized by formation of pseudomembrane in the larynx, airway obstruction, and systemic toxic manifestations.

- Spread usually from pharyngeal or nasal diphtheria to the larynx.

## Clinical Features

1. General features

   - Fever, malaise, anorexia
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy (“bull neck” in severe cases due to edema)

2. Local features (laryngeal involvement)

   - Hoarseness → aphonia
   - Cough (brassy, croupy)
   - Stridor (inspiratory), respiratory distress
   - Dysphagia
   - Cyanosis in severe obstruction

3. Oropharyngeal features

   - Greyish-white pseudomembrane that bleeds on removal
   - Extension from tonsil/pharynx to larynx

## Complications

1. Local

   - Acute airway obstruction (life-threatening)
   - Secondary bacterial infection

2. Systemic (toxin-mediated)

   - Myocarditis (arrhythmias, cardiac failure)
   - Neurological: cranial neuropathies, palatal paralysis, peripheral neuropathy
   - Nephritis

3. Others

   - Septicemia, death from airway compromise or cardiac failure

## Management

### Emergency (Airway Management)

- Assess airway urgently.
- If airway compromised:

  - Oxygen administration.
  - Nebulized adrenaline may help temporarily.
  - Intubation or emergency tracheostomy if severe obstruction.

### Specific Treatment

- **Antitoxin (Diphtheria antitoxin)**:

  - Given immediately (IV or IM, after sensitivity testing).
  - Neutralizes circulating toxin but does not affect toxin already bound to tissues.

- **Antibiotics**:

  - `Penicillin` (IV or IM) or `erythromycin` (oral/IV) for 14 days.
  - Eradicates organism and prevents spread.

### Supportive Care

- Bed rest.
- Adequate hydration and nutrition.
- Isolation to prevent spread.
- Monitor cardiac and neurological status for complications.

### Prevention

- Active immunization with DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine.
- Close contacts: prophylaxis with `erythromycin` or booster vaccination.
