# Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever

- **Causative Organism**:

  - _Dengue virus_ (DENV 1–4)
  - RNA virus, _Flavivirus_ genus, transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito

- **Incubation Period**:

  - **4–10 days** (range: 3–14 days)

- **Transmission**:

  - Mosquito bite → virus replication in lymph nodes → plasma leakage, thrombocytopenia

## Features of Shock

1. Abrupt fall in tempterature (usually on or after 3rd day of fever)
1. Sweating
1. Restlessness or drowsiness
1. Cold clammny extremities
1. Rapid thready pulse
1. Capillary refill time > 3 seconds
1. Narrow pulse pressure (< 20 mmHg) or Hypotension
1. Acute abdominal pain

## Severity Grading (WHO Classification)

1. **Grade I**:
   - Fever with positive tourniquet test [^1]
2. **Grade II**:
   - Grade I with spontaneous superficial bleeding
3. **Grade III (DSS Compensated Shock)**:
   - Features of Shock
4. **Grade IV (DSS Hypotensive Shock)**:
   - Profound shock with undetectable blood pressure and pulse

## Management of Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)

### Investigation

1. **CBC**
   - ↓ Platelet count (Thrombocytopenia): if \<100,000/mm3, risk of bleeding
   - ↓ WBC (Leukopenia): Typical in viral infection
   - ↑ Haematocrit: \>20% rises due to plasma leakage
1. **Dengue-specific Tests**
   - NS1 Antigen (Day 1-5)
   - IgM and IgG ELISA (after Day 5)
     - IgM: Recent infection
     - IgG: Past or secondary infection
   - RT-PCR (Day 1-7)
1. **Liver function tests**
   - ↑ AST, ALT
1. **Serum albumin and total protein**
   - ↓ Albumin due to plasma leakage
1. **Coagulation profile**
   - ↑ PT, aPTT
1. **Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine**
   - To assess dehydration, renal function, shock-related organ damage
1. **Ultrasound abdomen and chest**
   - To detect pleural effusion, ascites, gallbladder wall thickening

### Treatment

#### Initial Resuscitation (Within the First Hour)

##### Rapid IV bolus of isotonic fluids

- **Crystalloids** (`Ringer's lactate` or `0.9% normal saline`) are preferred.
- Initial bolus: `10–20 mL/kg over 15–30 minutes`.
- Assess the patient for clinical improvement (improved pulse, BP, capillary refill, warm extremities).
- If _improved_:
  - Reduce the rate to `5-7 ml/kg over 1 hour`.
  - Then, `3-5 ml/kg over 1 hour`
  - Then, `2-3 ml/kg over 1 hour`
  - Continue up to 24-48 hours
  - Then, stop IV fluid therapy
- If ~~not improved~~ after the first bolus:
  - Repeat bolus of crystalloids.
  - If _improved_, reduce the fluid as above.
  - If ~~not improved~~, switch to **colloids**

##### Colloid Solution

- Administer **colloids** (e.g., `Dextran-40` or `Albumin`) at `10–20 mL/kg over 1 hour`.
- If _improved_, reduce the fluid as above.
- If ~~not improved~~ and high PCV:
  - Increase infusion rate up to `30 ml/kg`
  - Consider **inotropic agents** (e.g., `dopamine`, `norepinephrine`).
- If ~~not improved~~ and low PCV:
  - Give **fresh whole blood transfusion**

##### Blood Transfusion

- Indicated if there is **significant bleeding** or **hemoglobin drops \<7 g/dL**.
- Transfuse **whole blood** or **packed red cells** to maintain adequate hemoglobin and oxygen delivery.
- If _improved_, **IV crystalloid** infusion and gradually reduce as above.

#### General Management

1. **Fever**:

   - Tepid sponging
   - Anti-pyretics

1. **Food**:
   - Adequate nutritional supplement

#### Ongoing Management and Monitoring

1. **Monitor for signs of fluid overload**:
   - Monitor the patient’s **weight, urine output, respiratory rate**, and **chest auscultation**.
2. **Vital Signs**:
   - Continuous monitoring :**blood pressure (BP)**, **pulse**, and **oxygen saturation**.
   - Then, reduce frequency as the patient stabilizes.
3. **Urine Output**
4. **Hematocrit Monitoring**
5. **Electrolyte and Glucose Monitoring**:
   - Monitor **serum sodium**, **potassium**, and **glucose**

#### Management of Complications

1. **Coagulopathy**:

   - **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)** if there is `active bleeding` or significantly deranged coagulation profiles.
   - **Platelet transfusion** if `platelet count <10,000 cells/mm³` or in the presence of bleeding.

1. **Electrolyte and Acid-Base Correction**:

   - **Slow sodium correction**: `hyponatremia`
   - **Bicarbonate**: `metabolic acidosis`

1. **Oxygen Therapy**:
   - **Oxygen** via nasal cannula or mask
   - **Mechanical ventilation**: **Respiratory failure** or severe pulmonary edema

#### Recovery Phase (After 24-48 Hours)

- **Fluid tapering**:

  - As plasma leakage decreases, **reduce IV fluid rates** to avoid fluid overload.
  - **Monitor for signs of recovery**:
    - Stable pulse, normalizing BP, good urine output, decreasing hematocrit.

- **Diuretics**:
  - **Fluid overload** (e.g., pulmonary edema): **diuretics** such as `furosemide`.

### Prevention

1. Prevention of mosquito bite at day time
   - Use of insecticide
   - Wearing protective clothes
   - Use of mosquito nets and screens
2. Removal of breeding places
   - Use of larvicide
   - Clear flower vases
   - Removal of all possible areas where water can collect

<summary>Tourniquet Test</summary>

> To assess capillary fragility

1. Patient should be relaxed, sitting position.
2. Measure blood pressure
3. Inflate a blood pressure cuff to a pressure midway between systolic and diastolic values
4. Maintain the pressure for **5 minutes**
5. Realse the cuff, wait for **1 minute**
6. Count the number of petechiae that appear in a `1 inch square` or `2.5 cm2` area on the skin below the cuff (forearm)

- Positive Test:
  - \> 10 petechiae per area at maximum site of petechiae
  - \> 20 peteachiae per area (Definitely positve)
- Negative Test:
  - < 10 petechiae per are
