# Measles

- **Causative Organism**:

  - _Measles virus_
  - RNA virus, _Paramyxoviridae_ family, _Morbillivirus_ genus

- **Incubation Period**:

  - **7–14 days** (average: 10 days to fever, 14 days to rash)

- **Transmission**:

  - Airborne droplets → replication in respiratory epithelium → viremia → rash

## Differential Diagnosis of Maculopapular Rash

> MM RIDE

1. **M**easles
1. **M**eningococcaemia
1. **R**ubella
1. **I**nfectious mononucleosis
1. **D**rug eruption
1. **E**nteroviral infection - Coxsackie A, B

## Clinical Features of Measles

### Prodromal Stage (3-5 days before eruptive stage)

> 3C - **C**onjunctivitis, **C**oryza, **C**ough

- Fever
- Conjunctivitis, catarrhal or coryza characterized by consistently running nose, and dry cough
- **Koplik's spots (pathognomonic sign)**
  - Small grayish white dots as small as grains of sand surrounded by reddish areola appear on the inner side of cheek opposite the lower molar teeth
  - Usually disappear rapidly within 12-18 hour

### Exanthematous Stage (4th day onwards)

- Confluent maculopapular rashes
- Start behind the ears and along the hair lines and on the posterior part of the cheek
- Spread rapidly to involve the face
- Then, downward and become generalized. Blotchy appearance
- In severe measles, it may become haemorrhagic (rare but fatal)

### Convalescent Stage

- When the rashes fade, brown staining of the skin and desquamation

## Complications

### 1. Respiratory

- Suppurative otitis media
- Tracheitis
- Laryngo tracheobronchitis
- Bronchitis (Bronchietasis)
- Bronchopneumonia: Secondary to bacteria infection e.g., Staphylococcal pneumonia
- Giant cell viral pneumonia (especially in immunocompromised child)
- Suppurative lung disease

### 2. Non-Respiratory

1. Central nervous system
   - Encephalitis
   - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
1. Opthalmic complication
   - Conjunctivitis
   - Keratitis
   - Corneal ulcer
1. Gastro-intestinal tract
   - Stomatitis
   - Cancrum oris
     - Gangrenous form of stomatitis due to anaerobic bacteria, Treponema vincenti
     - Rapidly spread to form sloughing of gums and jaws and perforation of cheek
     - In extreme case, teeth may be shed
     - Peculiar foul odour
   - Gastroenteritis
   - Persistent diarrhoea
1. Others
   - Malnutrition
   - Leucopenia
   - Thrombocytopenia

## Preventions

- Active immunization
  - According to UCI at 9 months of age
  - MMR may be given (12 months to 15 months) if available
