| **Onset**                | Appears **after 24 hrs** of life (commonly day 2–3)                                                                     | Appears **within first 24 hrs** or **after 2 weeks** of life                                                                                                           |

| **Duration**             | Resolves within 7 days (term) / 14 days (preterm)                                                                       | Persists >14 days (term) or >21 days (preterm)                                                                                                                         |

| **Causes**               | - Immature hepatic uptake & conjugation of bilirubin <br/> - Increased RBC turnover (shorter lifespan of neonatal RBCs) | - **Hemolysis**: Rh/ABO incompatibility, G6PD deficiency <br/> - **Sepsis** <br/> - **Biliary atresia** <br/> - **Metabolic disorders** (hypothyroidism, galactosemia) |
| **Risk to Infant**       | Benign, rarely harmful                                                                                                  | High risk of **kernicterus** and permanent neurological damage                                                                                                         |

## Phototherapy

> Phototherapy is a treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight).

### Indications

1. In the **term baby**, `serum bilirubin level > 15 mg%`
2. In the **preterm baby**, `serum bilirubin level > 10-12 mg%` but adjusted by gestational age or body weight
3. Before exchange transfusion, for prevention of further rise of serum bilirubin.

### Methods

- Blue tube photo (wavelength 450-475 nm) is better than white light (ordinary day light fluorescent)
- 4 or 6 in numbers of 2 feet or 4 feet fluorescent tube 18 inches from the cot or incubator
- Photothehrapy should be given continuously except feeding & toileting
- Expose the whole body. Cover the eyes.
- Turn the baby every 2-3 hours.
- Extra fluid: `20-30 ml/kg/24hour` is given by more frequent breastfeeding.

### Complications

1. **`R`etinal damage** - Retinopathy - `B`lindness
1. **`H`yperthermia/`H`ypothermia**
1. **Fluid loss** - `D`ehydration
1. **`D`iarrhoea** due to isomers which are hygroscopic
1. **Skin `r`ashes** due to histamine release
1. **`B`ronze baby syndrome** if phototherapy is given to the patient with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

## Exchange Transfusion

> An exchange transfusion is a blood transfusion in which the patient's blood or components of it are exchanged with other blood or blood products.

### Indications

1. **Rule** of thumb: `Term > 20 mg%`
2. Use bilirubin **charts** according to birth weight, gestational age, age of the baby
3. Consider exchange at **lower** serum bilirubin level if the baby has `hypoxia`, `hypoglycaemia`, `hypothermia`, `asphyxia`, `septicaemia`
4. **Rate** of rise of serum bilirubin is `> 1 mg%/hour` or `> 5 mg%/day`
5. **Severe** clinical jaundice associated with `imparied Moro's reflex`, `refusal to feed` and `lethargy` (impending bilirubin encephalopathy)

### Method

1. **Amount**: `Double volume exchange transfusion` (85ml/kg x 2 = 170 ml/kg). Topping up transfusion for correction of anaemia - 10 ml/kg - 20ml/kg
2. **Blood Product**: For safe blood transfusion, `fresh whole blood or < 3 days old blood` free from malaria, syphilis, hepatitis B/C, HIV
3. **Blood Type**: For ABO incompatibility, use `blood group O`. For Rh incompatibility, use `O(-ve)`. Other disease - Exchange with child's blood group
4. **Route** of exchange - `umbilical vein`
5. A **sample** portion of 5 ml for preterm & 10 ml for term
6. **`C`omplication**: After 100 ml, `1 ml of 10% Calcium Gluconate` [^1] is given to correct hypcalcaemia.
7. **C`om`plication**: Before and after exchange transfusion, `omit one feed each`.

[^1]: **Citrate** is used in blood bag to prevent coagulation. Citrate binds to calcium → Hypocalcaemia. To correct hypocalcaemia, `Calcium gluconate` is given.

### Complications

1. Catheter induced
   - Infection (portal pyaemia)
   - Air & blood clot thrombosis and embolism
   - Arrhythmia
2. Metabolic changes
   - Hyperglycemia followed by rebound hypoglycemia
   - Hypocalcemia
   - Acidosis
   - Hyperkalaemia
3. Incorrect calculation
   - Hypervolaemia
   - Hypovolaemia
4. Necrotizing enterocolitis
5. Hazards of blood transfusion including infections:
   - Syphilis
   - CMV
   - HIV
   - Hepatits B, C
   - Malaria infections
