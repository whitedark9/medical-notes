# G6PD Deficiency

> An **X-linked recessive enzymopathy** due to deficiency of the enzyme **glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase**.

- Leads to **impaired protection of red blood cells (RBCs)** from oxidative stress → episodic or chronic haemolysis.

## Pathophysiology

- G6PD is essential in the **hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt**.
- It produces **NADPH**, which regenerates **reduced glutathione**.
- Reduced glutathione → protects RBCs from oxidative damage.
- Deficiency → oxidative stress (from drugs, infections, foods) → RBC membrane damage & Heinz body formation → intravascular and extravascular haemolysis.

## Aetiology / Triggers of Haemolysis

1. **Drugs** (oxidant drugs):

   - Antimalarials: `primaquine`, `chloroquine`.
   - Sulfonamides: `sulfamethoxazole`.
   - Nitrofurans: `nitrofurantoin`.
   - Analgesics: high-dose `aspirin`.

2. **Infections**: commonest trigger in children.
3. **Foods**: _fava beans_ (favism).
4. **Chemicals**: naphthalene balls (mothballs).

## Clinical Features

- Usually asymptomatic until exposed to trigger.
- **Acute haemolytic crisis**:

  - Sudden pallor, jaundice, dark urine (haemoglobinuria).
  - Fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnoea.
  - Splenomegaly (variable).

- **Neonatal jaundice**:

  - Appears within first few days of life.
  - May cause kernicterus if severe.

- **Chronic complications**: gallstones, chronic haemolytic anaemia (rare).

## Diagnosis

### History

- Family history (X-linked).
- Recurrent jaundice or haemolysis after infections/drug intake.

### Examination

- Pallor, jaundice, dark urine.
- Hepatosplenomegaly (sometimes).

### Investigations

- **For diagnosis**:

  - G6PD enzyme assay (low enzyme activity confirms).
  - Peripheral smear: bite cells, blister cells, Heinz bodies (after supravital staining).

- **For haemolysis**:

  - CBC: anaemia.
  - Reticulocyte count: raised.
  - Indirect bilirubin: raised.
  - LDH: raised.
  - Direct Coombs test: negative (non-immune haemolysis).

- **For complications**: LFTs, renal function, urine analysis.

## Management

### Acute Haemolytic Episode

- Stop offending drug/food.
- Supportive: bed rest, hydration.
- Correct anaemia: `packed RBC transfusion` if severe.
- Treat precipitating infection with safe antibiotics.
- Monitor urine output & renal function.

### Neonatal Jaundice

- Phototherapy (first line).
- Exchange transfusion if bilirubin dangerously high.

### Long-Term Management

- Avoidance of trigger drugs and foods.
- Family screening & genetic counselling.
- Folic acid supplementation in chronic haemolysis.

## Complications

- Severe neonatal jaundice → kernicterus.
- Severe haemolytic crisis → acute renal failure.
- Chronic haemolysis → gallstones, anaemia.
