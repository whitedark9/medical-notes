# Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

> **ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura)**: An autoimmune disorder characterized by `isolated thrombocytopenia` (low platelet count) due to platelet destruction by autoantibodies.

## Etiology

- Autoimmune mechanism where antibodies target platelets.
- Can be idiopathic or secondary to infections (e.g., viral), medications, or autoimmune diseases.

## Differential Diagnosis of Purpuric Spots in 5 Years Old Child

1. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
1. Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP)
1. Haemophilia
1. Aplastic Anaemia
1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia
1. Meningococcal Septicaemia
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
1. Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)
1. Trauma

## Management of ITP

### Investigation

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:

- Isolated thrombocytopenia < 100,000/mm3
- Normal white blood cells
- Normal red blood cells

1. **Bleeding time**: Prolong
1. **Platelet antibodies**: Present in 70-90% of children
1. **Bone marrow**: Normal or increased megakaryocytes

### Treatment

#### Treatment of Acute ITP

##### Platelet Count > 40,000/mm3

- _No specific treatment_
- Avoid aspirin and related drugs
- Avoid intramuscular injections during the acute phase
- Admit to hospital if platelet count < 20,000/mm3

##### Platelet Count < 25,000/mm3

1. **Corticosteroids**
   - Inhibit platelet antibody production, interaction between platelet and antibodies, prolong platelet survival and improve vascular stability
   - `Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks`, followed by tapering the doses over the next 1-2 weeks, regardless the response
2. **Intravenous immunoglobin** (IV-IgG)
   - Increase platelet count by blocking Fc receptor and protects the platelets from antibodies
   - `IV-IgG 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days` **OR**
   - `IV-IgG 1 g/kg for 2 consecutive days`
3. **Intravenous anti-D therapy**
   - For life-threatening haemorrhage
4. **Splenectomy**

###### Indications

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="">
  
- Hypersplenism 
- When the transfusion requirement exceeds 250 ml/kg/year of
  packed red cells 
- Abdominal discomfort

</Callout>

- Children should be > 6 years to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis
- Children should be immunized with _meningococcal_, _pneumococcal_ and _H.influenzae_ vaccines.
- Life long `penicillin` prophylaxis after splenectomy
- Treatment of thrombosis after splenectomy with `aspirin`

##### Intracranial Haemorrhage (ICH)

- Common in platelet count < 20,000/mm3
- Platelet count should be increased rapidly with `IV-IgG`, `methylprednisolone` or `platelet transfusion`
- `Splenectomy` if above measures fail

---

#### Treatment of Chronic ITP

> Goal of therapy is to decrease the risk of serious haemorrhage, rather than to achieve normal platelet count

- `Corticosteroid`
- Immunosuppressives: `Cyclophosphamid`, `Azathioprine`, `Cyclosporin`
- `Splenectomy`
