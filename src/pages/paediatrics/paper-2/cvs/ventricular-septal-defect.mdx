# Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

<details>
<summary>Common congenital heart disease</summary>

### Acyanotic Congenital Heart Diseases

1. `Ventricular Septal Defect` (VSD)
1. `Atrial Septal Defect` (ASD)
1. `Patent Ductus Arteriosus` (PDA)

### Cyanotic Congenital Heart Diseases

1. `Tetralogy of Fallot` (TOF)
1. `Transposition of Great Vessels` (TGA)

</details>

> An opening (defect) in the ventricular septum, allowing oxygenated blood from the left ventricle mixed with deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle.

<summary>Pathophysiology</summary>

### Left-to-Right Shunt

> Blood flows abnormally from the **left side of the heart or systemic circulation (higher pressure)** to **the right side of the heart or pulmonary circulation (lower pressure)** through a congenital or acquired defect.

- Left ventricle has higher pressure than right ventricle
- **During systole**, blood flows from left ventricle to right ventricle through the ventricular septal defect (`Pansystolic murmur`) → Increase volume in right ventricle → Increase pulmonary circulation

### Increased Pulmonary Circulation

- Right ventricle pumps the extra blood into pulmonary arteries → Increase pulmonary blood flow (`Pulmonary hypertension`) → Increase blood returns to the left atrium via pulmonary veins

### Increase Left Atrial and Left Ventricular Filling

- **During diastole**, extra blood in the left atrium flows into the left ventricule → Increase blood flow through the mitral value **during systole** (low-pitched and rumbling `Mid-diastolic murmur` at the apex of the heart)

</details>

## Clinical Features

Depend on the size of the defect

### Small VSD (< 0.5-2 cm2)

- Asymptomatic
- **Pansystolic murmur**: [^1]
  - **Loudest**: at lower left sternal border
  - **Raditaion**: Right sternal border or entire precordium
  - The smaller the opening, the louder the murmur
  - Frequently thrill present

[^1]: **Pansystolic murmur**: Begin with the first heart sound (S1) and extend through the second heart sound (S2), covering the enterity of the systole

### Large VSD (> 1 cm2)

#### Symptoms

Usually present in early infant (around 6-10 weeks of age)

- Dyspnoea
- Feeding difficulties
- Poor growth
- Repeated chest infection (`respiratory infection`)
- Can develop `congested heart failure`

#### Signs

- Prominence of precordium (common)
- Cardiomegaly (downward and outward `displacement of apex beat`)
- Heaving apical impulse (`left ventricular hypertrophy`)
- `Pansystolic murmur`best heard at lower left sternal border
- `Second heart sound` may be increased due to pulmonary hypertension
- Thrill present
- `Mid-diastolic murmur` at the apex due to increase mitral valve flow

## Investigation

### CXR

- **Small VSD**:
  - Normal heart size
  - Normal pulmonary vascularity
- **Large VSD**:
  - Gross `cardiomegaly` (Left ventricule + Later right ventricle)
  - Increase pulmonary vascular markings (`plethoric lung field`)

### ECG

- **Small VSD**: Normal
- **Large VSD**: Left ventricular hypertrophy, Biventricular hypertrophy, Peak P-wave

### Echocardiogram

- Two dimension to detect structural defects - site, size, vegetations, chamber enlargement
- Doppler: To detect pressure gradient across defect, To visualize small defect of muscular septum

### Cardiac Catheterization

- Increase oxygen saturation and pressure in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery
- Pulmonary artery pressure is measured to calculate pulmonary blood flow and vascular resistance

## Treatment

### Small VSD

- Reassurance
- No restriction on physical activity
- Prophylaxis of `infective endocarditis`
- Long term follow up until `spontaneous closure` occurs

### Large VSD

#### Medical treatment

- Prevention and treatment of `respiratory infection`
- Control of `congestive heart failure`
- Prevention and treatment of `infective endocarditis`
- Nutritional support

#### Surgical treatment

- Closure of the defect (primary repair), using Dacron patch

##### Indication for Surgery

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="">

- Patient at any age with uncontrolled congestive heart failure
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Pulmonary systemic blood flow > 2 : 1

</Callout>

##### Contraindication

- Reversed shunt (right to left)
- Severe pulmonary vascular disease

### Others

- Pulmonary palliative banding with repair
- Catheter occlusion devices are also being tested for closuring the defect

## Complications

- **Spontaneous closure** (30-50%) in small defect during the first 2-4 years of life
- `Congestive heart failure` (CHF) [^2]
- `Infective endocarditis`
- `Eisenmenger Syndrome` [^3]
- Acquired infundibular pulmonary stenosis
- Pulmonary vascular disease (pulmonary arterial hypertension)

[^2]: CHF is a condition where heart cannot pump blood efficiently to meet the body's need, leading to a buildup of fluid (congestion) in the lungs and other tissues.

[^3]: **Eisenmenger Syndrome**: Acyanotic left-to-right shunt becomes cyanotic right-to-left shunt after some times.
