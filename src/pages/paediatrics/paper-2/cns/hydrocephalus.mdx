# Hydrocephalus

> Increase in size of the CSF spaces, associated with increase in intracranial pressure secondary to pathophysiological processes.

## Common Causes

### Congenital Causes

- Intrauterine infection (TORCH)
- Congenital malformation
- Aqeductal stenosis
- Arnold Chiari malformation (Downward displacement of portion of cerebellum and brain stem)
- Dandy Walker syndrome (Dilatation of 4th ventricle due to absence or deficiency of cerebellar vermis and 4th ventricle outlet)
- Intracranial bleeding

### Acquired Causes

- Meningitis (TB Meningitis, Pyogenic Meningitis)
- Intraventricular haemorrhage
- Trauma
- Tumour (Posterior fossa)

## Diagnosis

### Clinical features

- Headache
- Irritablility
- Anorexia
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Drownsiness or lethargy

#### Signs

- Inappropiately increasing OFC
- Tense anterior fontanelle
- Widened suture
- Distended scalp veins
- Setting-sun eyes (loss of upward gaze)
- Cracked pot sign
- Neck retraction or rigidity
- Signs of raised ICP
  - Bradycardia
  - Hypertension
  - Papilloedema
  - Opticatrophy
- Positive transillumination test

## Investigations

- **USG head**: Ventricular dilatation
- **CT scan**: Ventricular dilatation, Identification of some causes
- **Skull X-ray**:
  - Separation of sutures
  - Erosion of the posterior clinoids
  - Increase in convolutional markings

## Management

- Serial measurement of OFC
- Gradual slowing in progress of head size and becomes arrested (_No treatment_)
- If head size is progressing at fast rate , `Ventriculoperitoneal shunt`
- `Acetazolamide` in mild slowly progressive hydrocephalus
