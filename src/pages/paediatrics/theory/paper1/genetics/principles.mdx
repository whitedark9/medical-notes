# Principles of Prevention of Genetic Diseases

## Genetic Counseling

> A process of communication and information which deals with the problems associated with a genetic disease in the family.

### Aim

> To provide information to make a better choice in reproductive decisions

### Objectives

> DROP AI

- Establishing the **correct `d`iagnosis**
- **`R`isk** estimation
- Discussing the **`o`ptions** available
- **`P`revention** of genetic disease
- Reducing **`a`nxiety** and guilt
- Communication and **`i`nformation**

### Procedures

- **Communication and information** is the main part of counseling.
- Genetic counseling can be done by **any physician** who understands genetic mechanisms of diseases properly.
- If there is a risk to the offspring, the counselor discusses the **available options** such as
  - not having (more) children
  - ignoring the risk
  - artificial insemination
  - antenatal diagnosis
  - termination of pregnancy
- The counselor should be **non-directive** (he or she only assists in the decision-making process)

### Indications for Genetic Counseling

<Callout>

- Known or suspected `gene`tic disease in a patient or family
- Birth `defects` in previous children
- `Co`nsanguinity
- Identification of `ma`lformations by ultrasonography during pregnancy

## Prenatal/Antenal Diagnosis

### Screening Tests for Maternal Blood

1. Testing for `neutral tube defects`
1. Testing for `Down's syndrome` (Triple test)

### Ultrasound Screening

Following information can be obtained:

- Gestational age
- Multiple pregnancy
- Structural malformations (e.g., anencephaly)
- Foetal growth
- Amnotic fluid volume (Oligohydramios, Polyhydramios)

### Tissue Samplings (In utero)

1. **Chorionic villous sampling**
   - Done in first trimester
   - Test for `Chromosomal analysis`, `Enzyme analysis`, `DNA analysis`, `Congenital infection`
   - 2-4% risk of foetal loss
1. **Amniocentesis**
   - Done in second trimester
   - Test for `Chromosomal anlysis`, `Enzyme analysis`
   - 0.5-1% risk of foetal loss
1. **Fetal blood sampling**
   - Done after 18 weeks of gestation
   - Test for `Rapid chromosomal analysis`, `Severe rhesus isoimmunization assessment`, `Congenital infection serology`
1. **Fetal tissue sampling**
   - Skin biopsy, Embryo biopsy
