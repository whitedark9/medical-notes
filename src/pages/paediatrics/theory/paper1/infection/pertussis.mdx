# Pertussis

- **Causative Organism**:

  - _Bordetella pertussis_
  - Gram-negative coccobacillus

- **Incubation Period**:

  - **7–10 days** (range: 5–21 days)

- **Transmission**:

  - Droplet spread → adherence to respiratory cilia → toxin release → paroxysmal cough

## Clinical Features

### Catarrhal Stage

- Insidious onset
- Rhinitis, Sneezing, Lacrimation
- Fever and cough (**noctural** at first, **diurnal** later)

### Paroxysmal Stage

- Cough (Whooping cough)
  - with vomiting
  - repeated series of many coughing spasms with an expiration followed by a sudden deep violent inspiration with characteristic crowing sound (whoop)
- Congestion of the face
- Sweating
- Periorbital oedema
- Subconjunctival haemorrhage
- Ulceration of frenulum of tongue
- In the young infants, may present with apnoeic attack (no characteristic whoop)

### Convalescent Stage

- Cough and vomiting stop
- Duration of cough may persist for weeks or months
- Appetite becomes improved

## Complications

- Neurological
  - Encephalopathy
  - Cerebral haemorrhage
  - Convulsion
- Respiratory
  - Air leak syndrome
  - Lung collapse
  - Secondary bacterial infection
  - Bronchiectasis
  - Flaring of pulmonary tuberculosis
- Gastrointestinal
  - Hernia
  - Rectal prolapse
- Haematological
  - Leucocytosis with absolute lymphocytosis
- Others
  - Severe PEM
  - Otitis media
  - Subconjunctival haemorrhage
  - Frenular ulcer

## Investigation

- **Culture & Sensitivity**:
  - Per-nasal swab for organism
  - Cough plate culture for organism
- **Total and Differential Count**:
  - leucocytosis with absolute lympocyosis
- **Chest X-Ray**:
  - Perihilar infiltration, actelectasis emphysema
- **ELISA test**:
  - To detect serum IgM, IgG & IgA, pertussis toxin

## Treatment

### Specific

- Antibiotics are effective only in catarrhal stage, reduce transmission if given
  - `Oral Erythromycin 40-50 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided doses for 14 days`

### Supportive Care

- Cough suppressant
- Bronchodilator: `Oral salbutamol 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses`

## Prevention

- Active immunization (DPT) according to EPI program
- For close contact:
  - Unimmunized person: `erythromycin for 2 weeks` after contact, then immunized
  - Immunized children under 7 years: give booster dose of DPT
