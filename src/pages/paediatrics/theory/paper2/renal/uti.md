# Urinary Tract Infection

> Define the urinary tract infection(UTI) in children. List the causal organisms and clinical features of UTI. How to manage a child with pyuria? (UMTG)

## Definition

> UTI is identified by growth of a significant number of organism of a single specimen of urine, in the presence of symptoms.

## Causal Organisms

- _Escherichia coli_ (> 90% of first infection)
- _Klebsiella_
- _Pseudomonas aeroginosa_
- _Proteus mirabilis_
- _Staphylococcus saprophyticus_

## Clinical Features

### Upper Tract Signs (Pyelonephritis)

- Parenchymal involvement
- Risk of renal scar
- Fever
- General malaise/Irritability
- Lethargy
- Vomiting
- Loin pain/Abdominal pain

### Lower Tract Signs (Cystitis)

- No involvement of renal parenchyma
- No risk of scar
- Non-specific abdominal pain/Pain in supra-pubic area
- Urgency
- Frequency
- Wetting
- Hematuria

## Management of Pyuria

### Investigation

- Collect mid stream urine or suprapubic punctured urine
- Urinalysis:
  - Normal pH/alkaline urine
  - Urine microscopy
  - Pyuria: > 10 WBC/l in boys and > 50 WBC/l in girls
  - WBC, RBC present
  - Motile bacteria per high power field
- Dipstick analysis:
  - Nitrite test
  - Urine culture
- Imaging:
  - Renal ultrasound scan: To detect hydronephrosis, renal pevic dilatation
  - Plain X-Ray abdomen: To detect renal stone
  - IVP (Intravenous urogram): To detect renal anatomy and function
  - DMSA Scan (dimercaptosuccinic acid): To detect renal scarring
  - MCUG (Micturating Cysto-Urethro Gram)
  - DTPA (diethylene triaminepenta acetic acid)

### Treatment

#### Antibiotic Treatment

- **Oral** medication in children with cystitis
  - `Cotrimoxazole (Trimethroprim/sulfamethoxazole) 6-12 mg/kg` divided 12 hourly or
  - `Amoxicillin 20-40 mg/kg/day divided 8 hourly` or
  - `Augmentin 7.5-15 mg/kg/day 8 hourly` or
  - `Cephalosporin (Cephalexin) 20-50 mg/kg/day divided 6 hourly`
- Usual duration is 5-7 days for simple cystitis
- Broad-spectrum **parenteral** antibiotics for children with pyelonephritis (complicated UTI)
  - Combination of `aminoglycoside` and `Ampicillin or Augmentin or Third generation cephalosporin group`

#### Supportive Therapy

- Take **lots of fluid** for dysuria
- `Antipyretics` for fever
- `Analgesics` for severe bladder spams
