# Acute Diarrhoea

## Assessment of a Child with Diarrhoea

### History

Ask the mother or caretaker about:

- duration of diarrhoea
- number of watery stools per day
- presence of blood in the stool
- number of episodes of vomiting
- presence of fever, cough or other important problems (e.g., convulsions, recent measles)
- pre-illness feeding practices
- type and amount of fluids (including breast milk) and food taken during the illness
- drugs or other remedies taken
- immunization history

### Physical Examination

First, check for signs and symptoms of dehydration.

|                   | A                             | B                                 | C                                    |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| General Condition | Well, alert                   | Restless, irritable               | Lethargic or unconscious             |
| Eyes              | Normal                        | Sunken                            | Sunken                               |
| Thirst            | Drink normally or not thirsty | Thirsty, Drinks eagerly           | Drinks poorly or can't drink         |
| Skin Pinch        | Goes back quickly             | Goes back slowly                  | Goes back very slowly                |
| Decide            | No signs of dehydration       | (>=2 signs in B) Some dehydration | (>= 2 signs in C) Severe dehydration |
| Treat             | Treatment Plan A              | Treatment Plan B                  | ~~Treatment Plan C (Urgently)~~      |

## Management

### Objectives

- **Prevent dehydration** if it does not exist
- **Treate dehydration**, if it exists
- **Prevent nutritional damage**
- **Give supplemental zinc** to reduce severity, duration and recurrence of the diarrhoea

### Treatment Plan A

Home therapy to prevent dehydration and malnutrition

#### Rule 1

> Give the child more fluids than usual to prevent dehydration.

##### Suitable Fluids

1. Fluids that contains salt
   - ORS solution
   - Salted drinks (e.g., salted rice water, satled yoghurt drink)
   - Vegetable or chicken soup with salt
2. Fluids that do not contain salt
   - Plain water
   - Unsalted rice water
   - Unsalted soup
   - Yoghurt drinks without salt
   - Green coconut water
   - Unsweetened tea
   - Unsweetened fresh fruit juice

##### Unsuitable Fluids

- Commercial carbonated beverages
- Commercial fruit juices
- Sweetened tea
- Coffee
- Some medical teas or infusions

##### How Much Fluid to Give

Give as much as the child or adult wants until diarrhoea stops.

#### Rule 2

> Give supplemental `zinc` (10-20 mg) to the child, every day for 10 to 14 days.

- Reduce the duration
- Reduce severity of the diarrhoea
- Reduce the risk of dehydration
- Prevent new episode of diarrhoea in the following 2-3 months

#### Rule 3

> Continue to feed the child to prevent malnutrition.

- Do not reduce feeding
- Continue usual diet, especially breastfeeding

##### What food to give

- Foods suitable for a child with diarrhoea are the same as those required by healthy children

##### How much food and how often

- Frequent, small feedings is better than less frequent, large feedings
- Feed the child **every 3 or 4 hours (6 times a day)**

##### How to feed after diarrhoea

- After diarrhoea, continue to give energy-rich foods
- Provide **one extra meal** than usual each day for at least 2 weeks or till the child regains normal weight-for-height

#### Rule 4

> Take the child to a health worker if there are signs of dehydration or other problems.

Take the child to a health work if the child:

- starts to pass many watery stools
- has repeated vomitig
- becomes very thirsty
- is eating or drinking poorly
- develops a fever
- has blood in the stool or
- does not get better in 3 days.

### Treatment Plan B

For children with some dehydration

- Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with ORS solution
- Zinc supplement

#### How much ORS solution is needed

> Approximate amount of ORS to give in the first 4 hours

| **Age**       | < 4 months | 4-11 months | 12-23 months | 2-4 years  | 5-14 years | > 15 years |
| :------------ | :--------- | :---------- | :----------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Weight**    | < 5kg      | 5-7.9 kg    | 8-10.9 kg    | 11-15.9 kg | 16-29.9 kg | > 30 kg    |
| **ORS in ml** | 200-400    | 400-600     | 600-800      | 800-1200   | 1200-2200  | 2200-4000  |

- **If the child's weight is known**, approximate amount of ORS solution is the child's weight in kg multiplied by 75 ml.
- **If the child's weight is unknonw**, select the approximate amount according to the child's age.
- If the child wants more than the approximate amount, give more if there are no signs of over-hydration.
  - Sign of over-hydration: Oedematous (puffy) eyelid
  - If this occurs, stop giving ORS solution, but can give breastmilk or plain water, and food. Do not give diuretic.
- When the oedema is gone, resume giving ORS solution.

#### How to give ORS solution

- A family member should be taught to prepare and give ORS solution.
  - In babies: Use a dropper or syringe (without the needle).
  - In infants and young children: Use a clean spoon or cup. Do not use bottles.
  - In older children: Use the cup.
- Vomiting often occurs during 1-2 hours after treatment, especially when the children drinks ORS solution too quickly.
- If the child vomits,
  - Wait 5-10 minutes
  - Resume giving ORS solution but more slowly.

#### Monitor the progress of ORT

- Check signs of dehydration
  - If **signs of severe dehydration** developed, switch to Treatment Plan C.
  - If **signs of some dehydration** still exists, repeat Treatment Plan B by giving ORT. This time, food, milk and other fluids can be given. Reassess the child frequently.
  - If **no signs of dehydration**, the child is considered to be fully rehydrated.

##### Signs of rehydration

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="">

- Skin pinch is normal
- Thirst is gone.
- Urine is passed
- The child is no longer irritable, often quiet or falls asleep.

</Callout>
  
- **Teach the mother** how to treat her child at home with ORS solution and food according to Treatment Plan A.
- Give her enough ORS packets for 2 days.
- Teach her the signs that mean she should bring her child back.

#### Giving Zinc

- After initial 4 hour rehydration therapy, give supplemental zinc as in Treatment Plan A.

#### Giving Food

- During initial 4 hour rehydration therapy, food should not be given except for breastmilk.
- However, children continued on Treatment Plan B longer than 4 hours should be given food every 3-4 hours as in Treatment Plan A.
- All children older than 6 months should be given some food before sending them home.

---

### Treatment Plan C

For children with severe dehydration

- Rapid intravenous rehydration
- Admitted to hospital.

#### Guideline for IV treatment of children and adults with severe dehydration

> Start IV fluids immediately. If patient can drink, give ORS solution orally until the drip is set up.

- Give `100 ml/kg Ringer's Lactate Solution` divided as follows:
- If `Ringer's Lactate Solution` is not available, `normal saline` may be used.

| Age                   | First give 30 ml/kg in | Then give 70 ml/kg in |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------- |
| < 12 months (infants) | 1 hour                 | 5 hours               |
| Older                 | 30 minutes             | 2.5 hours             |

- Reassess every 1-2 hours. If hydration is not improved, give IV drop more rapidly.
- After 6 hours (infants) or 3 hours (older patients), reassess the patient and choose the appropriate Treatment Plan (A or B or C).
- Repeat once if radial pulse is still very weak or not detectable.
