# Disorders of Larynx

## Dysphonia (Hoarseness of Voice)

### Causes

1. Inflammatory
   - Acute laryngitis
   - Chronic laryngitis
1. Neoplasia
   - Larynx Cancer
   - Papillomata
1. Neurological
   - Myasthenia gravis
   - Lung Cancer
   - Breast Cancer
   - Post thyroidectomy
1. Systemic
   - Hypothyroidism: Chronic edema of vocal cord
   - Rheumatoid arthritis: Fixation of cricoarytenoid joint
   - Angioneurotic edema: Type I allergic response

## Acute Laryngitis

### Causes [#laryngitis]

- Infection (Common)
  - Upper respiratory tract infection
  - Associated with pain in throat
- Non-infection
  - Shouting
  - Foreign bodies
  - Fumes, Tobacco, Smokes or Chemicals

## Larynx Cancer

- Old age
- Male
- Smoking, Alcohol
- Hoarseness of voice
- Stridor
- Direct laryngoscopy and biopsy
- Surgery and Radotherapy

## Juvenile Recurrent Respiratory Papilloma (JRRP)

- Children
- Human papilloma virus
- Warty lesions

## Laryngeal Stridor

### Causes [#Stridor]

1. Congenital
   - Laryngeal stenosis
   - Laryngomalacia (Congenital softness of larynx)
   - Laryngeal web
1. Traumatic
   - External: Blunt trauma on larynx
   - Internal: Foreign bodies, Corrosive substances, Fumes
1. Infection
   - Acute laryngotracheobronchitis
   - Acute epiglottitis
   - Ludwig's angina
   - Diphtheria
1. Tumor
   - Benign - Papillomas (JRRP)
   - Malignant - Ca larynx
1. Neurological
   - Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy
   - Bulbar palsy
1. Miscellaneous
   - Angioneurotic edema

### Emergency Management

- Relief of stridor is more important than knowing causes of stridor
- Oxygen inhalation
- ~~Tracheostomy~~ (Don't wait for obvious cyanosis)

## Tracheostomy

> An operation where an opening is made in the anterior wall of trachea and converted it to stoma

### Indication [#tracheo]

1. Relief of upper airway obstruction (stridor)
1. Protection of tracheo-bronchial tree & To facilitate tracheal toilet
1. Treatment of respiratory insufficiency

### Standard Method

1. Anaesthesia - LA or GA
1. Position - Supine position, extended neck (pillow under the shoulder)
1. Incision - Horizontal incisions at midway between cricoid and suprasternal notch
1. Procedure
   - Strap muscles are separated laterally
   - Thyroid isthmus is lifted up or divided
   - A circular opening is made over 3rd and 4th tracheal ring in adult and midline slit is made in children
   - Tracheostomy tube is inserted with dilator
   - Bleeding points were secured
   - Tracheostomy tube was secured with tape

### Complications

1. Haemorrhage and infection
1. Dislodgement of tube
1. Injury to surrounding structures
1. Surgical emphysema, Pneumothora
1. Tube blockage (by dry mucous forming crusts)
1. Subglottic stenosis (1st ring was cut)
1. Decannulation problem

## Foreign Bodies

### Inhaled Foreign Bodies

- Under 4 years (75%)
- Features depend on types and location in laryngotracheobronchial tree
- Vegetable materials - Severe mucosal reaction
- Maybe rapidly fatal
- First aids (Heimlich manoeuvre)

#### Clinical Features

Child previous healthy with sudden onset of

- Aphonia
- Wheezing, Stridor
- Choking, Coughing
- Chest and next X-ray
- Scopy

### Swallowed Foreign Bodies

Sites

- (Mostly) tonsils
- Root of tongue
- Valeculla
- Pyriform fossa
- Post cricoid
- Oesophagus

#### Clinical Features [#swallow]

- Foreign body sensation
- Dysphagia (Difficult swallowing)
- Odynophagia
- Regurgitation
- Signs and symptoms of complication (abscess)
