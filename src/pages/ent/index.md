# Anatomy of Ear

- Present in a pair
- **Function**: Hearing & Balance

## External Ear

### Auricle (Pinna)

- Cartilaginous covered by skin
- **Function**: `Collect sound waves` and direct them into the ear canal

### External Auditory Canal

- 2.5 cm long
- A tube running from the auricle to the tympanic membrane (eardrum)
- Contains `ceruminous glands` that produce earwax (cerumen)
- **Function**: `Transmit sound waves` to the eardrum

### Tympanic Membrane (Eardrum)

- Thin, cone-shaped membranethat separates the external ear from the middle ear
- **Function**: Vibrates in response to sound waves, `transmit these vibrations` to the `ossicles` in the middle ear

## Middle Ear

### Ossicles

- Consist of three parts: Malleus (Hammer), Incus (Anvil), Stapes (Stirrup)

1. **Malleus (Hammer)**: Attached to tympanic membrane
1. **Incus (Anvil)**: Connect the malleus to stapes
1. **Stapes (Stirrup)**: `Transmit vibrations` to the oval window of `cochlea`

- **Functions**: `Amplify and transmit sound vibrations` to the inner ear

### Eustachian Tube

- Canal that connects the middle ear to the `nasopharynx` of pharynx (Throat)
- **Functions**: `Equalize air pressure` on both sides of tympanic membrane

## Inner Ear

### Cochlea

- Spiral-shaped, fluid-filled organ
- **Function**: `Convert` sound vibrations into electrical signals via the `organ of Corti`, `Transmit` these signals to the brain via the `auditory nerve`

### Vestibular System

![Vestibule](/ent/vestibule.jpg)

- Includes the semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule
- **Function**: `Maintain balance` and spatial orientation

## Common Ear Disorders

### External Ear Disorders

#### Otitis Externa (Swimmer's ear)

- Inflammation of the external auditory canal (bacterial, fungal)
- **Symptoms**: Pain, Itching, Redness, Discharge

#### Cerumen Inpaction

- Too many earwax blocking the ear canal
- **Symptoms**: Hearing loss, Earache, Fullness in the ear

#### Foreign Bodies

- Foreign bodies in the ear canal
- **Symptoms**: Pain, Hearing loss, Infection

---

### Middle Ear Disorders

#### Otitis Media

- Infection or inflammation of the middle ear
- **Symptoms**: Pain, Hearing loss, Fever, Fluid drainage
- **Types**: `Acute otitis media (AOM)`, `Otitis media with effusion (OME)`

#### Eustachian Tube Dysfunction

- Blockage or dysfunction of eustachian tube >>> Pressure imbalance
- **Symptoms**: Ear fullness, Hear loss, Discomfort

#### Tympanic Membrane Perforation

- Tear or hele in the eardrum
- **Symptoms**: Sudden pain, Hearing loss, Fluid drainage

#### Otosclerosis

- Abnormal bone growth around the stapes >>> Conductive hearing loss
- **Symptoms**: Progressive hearing loss, Possible tinnitus (Buzzing or ringing sound)

---

### Inner Ear Disorders

#### Meniere's Disease

- Disorder of inner ear
- **Symptoms**: Severe dizziness, Ear fullness, hearing loss, Tinnitus

#### Labyrinthitis

- Inflammation of the inner ear labyrinth (viral infection)
- **Symptoms**: Vertigo, Hearing loss, Imbalance

#### Vestibular Neuritis

- Inflammation of the vestibular nerve (viral infection)
- **Symptoms**: Sudden severe, Vertigo, Nausea, Imbalance

#### Sensorineural Hearing Loss

- Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve
- **Causes**: Aging (presbycusis), Noise exposure, Infection, Ototoxic medication
- **Symptoms**: Gradual hearing loss

---

### Others

#### Tinnitus

- Perception of noise or ringing in ears without external sound source
- **Causes**: Hearing loss, Ear injury, Circulatory system disorders
- **Symptoms**: Ringing, Buzzing, Hissing, Clicking sounds

#### Acoustic Neuroma

- Benign tumor on the auditory nerve
- **Symptoms**: Hearing loss, Tinnitus, Balance problems

---

### Diagnosis

![Otoscope](/ent/otoscope.jpg)

- Otoscopic examination
- Audiometry tests (hearing test)
- Tympanometry
- Imaging (CT or MRI) for structural abnormalities
