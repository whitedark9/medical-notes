# Treatment of Tuberculosis (TB)

## Fixed Dose Combination (FDC)

> A formulation that combines two or more anti-TB drugs in a single tablet. This reduces the pill burden and helps ensure that patients take all the required medications.

### Benefits

- **Improved Adherence**: Simplifies the treatment regimen, making it easier for patients to comply.
- **Reduced Risk of Resistance**: Ensures that all drugs are taken together, decreasing the chance of developing drug resistance.
- **Simplified Logistics**: Easier to distribute and manage drug supplies.

## Treatment Regimens

### New Case (Drug-Susceptible TB)

> A patient who has never received TB treatment or has taken anti-TB drugs for less than one month.

| Phase              | Drugs (FDC or individual drugs)                                                 | Duration |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Intensive Phase    | `Isoniazid` (INH), `Rifampicin` (RIF), `Pyrazinamide` (PZA), `Ethambutol` (EMB) | 2 months |
| Continuation Phase | `Isoniazid` (INH), `Rifampicin` (RIF)                                           | 4 months |

### Retreatment Case

> A patient who has previously been treated for TB and is now returning due to treatment failure, relapse, or interruption.

| Phase                | Drugs (FDC or individual drugs)                                                                      | Duration |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Intensive Phase      | `Isoniazid` (INH), `Rifampicin` (RIF), `Pyrazinamide` (PZA), `Ethambutol` (EMB), `Streptomycin` (SM) | 2 months |
| Continuation Phase 1 | `Isoniazid` (INH), `Rifampicin` (RIF), `Pyrazinamide` (PZA), `Ethambutol` (EMB)                      | 1 month  |
| Continuation Phase 2 | `Isoniazid` (INH), `Rifampicin` (RIF), `Ethambutol` (EMB)                                            | 5 months |

### Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB)

> TB that is resistant to at least `isoniazid` (INH) and `rifampicin` (RIF), the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs.

| Phase              | Drugs                                                                                                                                                                               | Duration     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Intensive Phase    | At least 5 drugs, including a fluoroquinolone (e.g., `moxifloxacin`), a second-line injectable (e.g., `amikacin`), and other second-line drugs (e.g., `ethionamide`, `cycloserine`) | 6-8 months   |
| Continuation Phase | At least 4 effective drugs (e.g., `fluoroquinolone`, `ethionamide`, `cycloserine`, `linezolid`)                                                                                     | 12-18 months |

### Extensively Drug-Resistant TB (XDR-TB)

> MDR-TB that is also resistant to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of the three second-line injectable drugs (`amikacin`, `kanamycin`, or `capreomycin`).

| Phase              | Drugs (individualized regimen)                                                                  | Duration     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Intensive Phase    | May include `bedaquiline`, `linezolid`, `delamanid`, `clofazimine`, and other second-line drugs | 6-8 months   |
| Continuation Phase | Effective drugs based on susceptibility testing                                                 | 18-24 months |

## Contraindicated Drugs in Children

- **`Ethambutol` (EMB)**: Generally avoided in very young children due to the risk of optic neuritis and difficulty in monitoring visual acuity.
- **`Fluoroquinolones`**: Typically avoided unless necessary due to concerns about effects on cartilage development.
