# Diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB)

## Clinical Diagnosis

### History

- **Symptoms**:
  - Persistent cough (≥2 weeks)
  - Hemoptysis
  - Fever, especially with evening rise
  - Night sweats
  - Unintentional weight loss
  - Fatigue
- **Exposure History**:
  - Contact with a known TB patient
  - Travel to or residence in TB-endemic areas
  - History of prior TB or treatment

### Physical Examination

- **General Signs**: Cachexia, pallor, fever
- **Lung Examination**: Crackles, bronchial breath sounds
- **Lymph Nodes**: Enlarged, non-tender lymph nodes, particularly in cervical or supraclavicular regions
- **Extrapulmonary TB**: Site-specific signs (e.g., neck stiffness in TB meningitis, bone pain in skeletal TB)

## Microbiological Diagnosis

### Sputum Examination

- **Sputum Smear Microscopy**:
  - **Ziehl-Neelsen Staining**: Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) appear red against a blue background.
  - **Fluorescent Microscopy**: Using auramine-rhodamine staining, AFB fluoresce yellow-green.
- **Sputum Culture**:
  - **Solid Media**: Lowenstein-Jensen medium; growth detection takes 2-8 weeks.
  - **Liquid Media**: Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT); faster detection within 1-3 weeks.
  - **Colony Morphology**: Rough, buff-colored colonies on solid media.

### Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)

- **GeneXpert MTB/RIF**: Detects M. tuberculosis DNA and rifampicin resistance within 2 hours.
- **PCR**: Detects TB-specific genetic sequences.

### Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)

- **Phenotypic Methods**: Culture-based testing for resistance to first-line drugs (e.g., rifampicin, isoniazid).
- **Genotypic Methods**: Detection of resistance genes (e.g., rpoB for rifampicin resistance).

### Immunological Tests

- **Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) - Mantoux Test**:
  - **Procedure**: Intradermal injection of purified protein derivative (PPD).
  - **Interpretation**:
    - **≥5 mm Induration**: Positive in high-risk groups (HIV-infected, recent contacts, immunosuppressed).
    - **≥10 mm Induration**: Positive in moderate-risk groups (recent immigrants, IV drug users, high-risk congregate settings).
    - **≥15 mm Induration**: Positive in individuals with no known risk factors.
- **Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs)**:
  - **Types**: QuantiFERON-TB Gold, T-SPOT.TB.
  - **Procedure**: Blood test measuring the immune response to TB antigens.
  - **Advantages**: Not affected by prior BCG vaccination, requires a single patient visit.

## Radiological Diagnosis

### Chest X-ray (CXR)

- **Pulmonary TB Findings**:
  - Infiltrates or consolidations, often in the upper lobes
  - Cavitations
  - Hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy
  - Pleural effusion
- **Miliary TB Findings**:
  - Diffuse, small nodular shadows resembling millet seeds.

### Computed Tomography (CT) Scan

- **Indications**: Complex cases or inconclusive CXR findings.
- **Findings**: Detailed evaluation of lung parenchyma, lymph nodes, pleura, and other thoracic structures.
