# Tuberculosis (TB)

## _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_

### Characteristics

- **Type**: Rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, acid-fast bacterium.
- **Cell Wall**: High lipid content, including mycolic acids, making it resistant to desiccation, disinfectants, and many antibiotics.
- **Growth**: Slow-growing, taking 15-20 hours to divide (compared to 20-30 minutes for many other bacteria).
- **Culture**: Requires specialized media (Lowenstein-Jensen or Middlebrook) and takes 2-8 weeks to grow in a laboratory.

### Survival and Environment

- **Aerobic**: Requires oxygen for growth; primarily affects the lungs but can survive in other oxygen-rich tissues.
- **Resistant to Drying**: Can survive in dried sputum for weeks.
- **Temperature**: Thrives at 37°C (body temperature) but can survive in a range of temperatures.
- **Resilience**: Survives in hostile environments, including acidic and alkaline conditions.

### Incubation Period

- **Initial Infection to Primary Disease**: Typically 2-12 weeks after exposure.
- **Latency**: Bacteria can remain dormant for years or decades, reactivating when the host's immune system is compromised.

## Mode of Transmission

- **Airborne Transmission**: Spread through inhalation of droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis.
  - **Droplet Nuclei**: Tiny particles (1-5 microns in diameter) expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or sings.
  - **Prolonged Exposure**: Close and prolonged contact with an infected individual increases the risk of transmission.
  - **Infectious Dose**: As few as 1-10 inhaled bacilli can establish an infection.

## Types of TB

### Pulmonary TB

- **Primary TB**: Initial infection typically in the middle or lower lung zones.
- **Post-primary (Reactivation) TB**: Reactivation of latent infection, often in the upper lung zones.

### Extrapulmonary TB

- **Lymphatic TB**: Involvement of lymph nodes.
- **Pleural TB**: Infection of the pleura.
- **Skeletal TB**: Involves bones and joints.
- **Genitourinary TB**: Affects the urinary and genital systems.
- **CNS TB**: Includes tuberculous meningitis and tuberculoma.
- **Miliary TB**: Disseminated TB infection affecting multiple organs.

## Pathophysiology

1. **Inhalation of M. tuberculosis** → Reaches alveoli in the lungs.
2. **Phagocytosis by Alveolar Macrophages** → Bacteria multiply within macrophages (WBCs).
3. **Granuloma Formation**:
   - **Immune Response**: Infected macrophages release cytokines and attract other immune cells.
   - **Granuloma**: Aggregation of immune cells (macrophages, T lymphocytes) forming a barrier to contain the infection.
4. **Latent TB Infection**: Bacteria remain dormant within granulomas.
5. **Reactivation**: Immune suppression or other factors → Breakdown of granuloma → Reactivation of bacteria → Active TB.

## Clinical Features

### Pulmonary TB

- **Chronic Cough**: Often productive of sputum, which may be blood-tinged (hemoptysis).
- **Fever**: Low-grade, persistent, often with evening rise.
- **Night Sweats**: Profuse sweating during sleep.
- **Weight Loss**: Unexplained, progressive.
- **Fatigue**: General feeling of tiredness and weakness.
- **Chest Pain**: Due to pleuritis or extensive lung involvement.

### Extrapulmonary TB

- **Lymphatic TB**: Swollen, non-painful lymph nodes.
- **Pleural TB**: Pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and pleural effusion.
- **Skeletal TB**: Localized pain, swelling, and reduced mobility in the affected bone or joint.
- **Genitourinary TB**: Dysuria, hematuria, and flank pain.
- **CNS TB**: Headache, fever, altered mental status, and neurological deficits.
- **Miliary TB**: Non-specific symptoms like fever, weakness, and weight loss; may involve multiple organs.
