# Pre-Operative

## Pre-Operative Assessment

> A comprehensive evaluation of a patient’s health status before surgery to identify and mitigate potential risks.

### Components of Preoperative Assessment

#### Medical History

- **Current Medications**: List of all prescribed, over-the-counter, and herbal medications.
- **Allergies**: Any known drug, food, or latex allergies.
- **Previous Surgeries**: Past surgical history and any complications experienced.
- **Anesthetic History**: Previous reactions to anesthesia, if any.
- **Medical Conditions**: Chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions, renal or hepatic disorders.
- **Family History**: Relevant medical conditions in family members, particularly those that could affect anesthesia.

#### Physical Examination

- **General Examination**: Overall physical health including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature).
- **Cardiovascular System**: Heart sounds, murmurs, jugular venous pressure.
- **Respiratory System**: Breath sounds, signs of respiratory distress.
- **Neurological System**: Mental status, cranial nerve function, motor and sensory function.
- **Musculoskeletal System**: Joint mobility, muscle strength, any deformities.
- **Abdominal Examination**: Organomegaly, tenderness, masses.
- **Airway Assessment**: Mallampati score, neck circumference, dentition, jaw movement.

#### Diagnostic Tests

- **Laboratory Tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, renal function tests, liver function tests, coagulation profile.
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, ECG, echocardiogram for patients with significant cardiac history.
- **Special Tests**: Pulmonary function tests for patients with respiratory diseases, stress tests for those with cardiac conditions.

### Risk Stratification

#### ASA Physical Status Classification System

1. **ASA I**: Healthy patient with no systemic disease.
1. **ASA II**: Patient with mild systemic disease.
1. **ASA III**: Patient with severe systemic disease but not incapacitating.
1. **ASA IV**: Patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life.
1. **ASA V**: Moribund patient not expected to survive without the operation.
1. **ASA VI**: Declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes.

### Special Considerations

- **Pediatric Patients**: Developmental history, immunization status, family’s psychological preparedness.
- **Geriatric Patients**: Cognitive function, mobility, polypharmacy, nutritional status.
- **Pregnant Patients**: Gestational age, obstetric history, fetal well-being.
  Preoperative Optimization
- **Medical Optimization**: Control of blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and treatment of any infections.
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Smoking cessation, alcohol intake reduction, weight management.
- **Patient Education**: Explanation of the surgical procedure, anesthesia, expected outcomes, and potential risks. Instruction on fasting guidelines and postoperative care.
  Applied Anatomy and Physiology
- **Airway Management**: Knowledge of airway anatomy is crucial for assessing potential difficulties with intubation.
- **Cardiovascular Evaluation**: Understanding the physiology of the heart and vascular system helps in risk assessment and management of perioperative cardiovascular events.
- **Respiratory Assessment**: Insights into respiratory mechanics and gas exchange are essential for evaluating pulmonary risk and optimizing ventilation strategies.

## American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Guidelines

> Guidelines to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anaesthesia.

### Clear Liquid

- Water, fruit juices without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea and black coffee.
- ~~Not include alcohol.~~
- **Minimum fasting period**: `2 hours` before anaesthesia

### Breast Milk

- **Minimum fasting period**: `4 hours` before anaesthesia

### Infant Formula

- **Minimum fasting period**: `6 hours` before anaesthesia

### Non-human Milk

- Includes cow's milk and milk-based products
- **Minimum fasting period**: `6 hours` before anaesthesia

### Light Meal

- Meals that do not include fried or fatty foods or meat
- **Minimum fasting period**: `6 hours` before anaesthesia

### Full Meal

- Meals including fried or fatty foods or meat
- **Minimum fasting period**: `8 hours` before anaesthesia.

### Medications

- Patients should be instructed to take essential medications (e.g., antihypertensives, antiepilepticss) with a small sip of water

### Gastrointestinal Stimulants

- GI stimulants may be preoperatively administered to patients at increased risk of pulmonary aspiration.
- Do not routinely administer preoperative GI stimulants for the purpose of reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration in patients with no apparent increased risk for pulmonary aspiration.
