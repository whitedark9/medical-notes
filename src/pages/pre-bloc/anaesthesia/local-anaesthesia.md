# Local Anaesthesia (LA)

> Administration of anesthetic agents to a specific part of the body to block sensation, especially pain, in that localized area

- Local anesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium channels** in the neuronal membrane, preventing the initiation and propagation of **nerve impulses**.
- The effect is **reversible**, allowing normal sensation to return after the drug wears off
- e.g., `Lidocaine`, `Bupivacaine`

## Maximum Safe Dose

- `Lidocaine`: 3 mg/kg, 7 mg/kg (with epinephrine)
- `Bupivacaine`: 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg (with epinephrine)

## Local Anaesthetic Toxicity

> Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) is a life-threatening condition when LA is absorbed into the systemic circulation in excessive amounts.

- Mainly caused by the intrinsic effects of local anaesthetics in blocking conduction in all excitable tissues, particularly the CNS and CVS

### Causes

1. Excessive dosage
1. Direct IV injection
1. Rapid absorption
1. Delayed metabolism
1. Delayed excretion
1. Drug interaction
1. Increased sensitivity
1. Prolonged infusion

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

- The CNS is more sensitive, and CNS symptoms and signs are usually present first

#### Initial Symptoms

- Circumoral parasthesia (Abnormal sensation of numbness or tingling around the mouth)
- Tongue numbness
- Tinnitus (Buzzing or ringing sound)
- Blurred vision

#### Progressive Symptoms

- Agitation (Feeling nervous)
- Muscle twitching
- Drownsiness
- Respiratory depression
- Convulsions
- Coma

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)

- Decrease the rate of deploarization, action potential duration and refractory period in cardiac conducting tissues

#### ECG Changes

- **Early**: Tachycardia, Hypertension
- **Intermediate**: Bradycardia, Prolong PR interval, QRS complex and QT interval
- **Severe**: Arrhythamias, Cardiac arrest (More likely in the presence of acidosis or hypoxia)

### Others

1. Direct IV injection (especially arterial injection in the head and neck)
   - Blindness
   - Aphasia (Language disorder)
   - Hemiparesis
   - Convulsions
   - Respiratory depression
   - Coma or cardiac arrest
1. **Lipid solubility and potency**: `Bupivacaine` is more toxic than `lidocaine`
1. Systemic toxitiy depends on the **drug and mass injection**, **site of injection** and **use of vascoconstrictors**
1. **Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions** may occur with `ester local anaesthesia`
1. `Prilocaine`, and less commonly `benzocaine` or `lidocaine`, may cause **methaemoglobinaemia**.

### Risk Factors

- Proximal injection site (e.g, intercostal, head and neck or upper limb blocks)
- Surgical use of high drug volumes for procedures such as tissue infiltration and tumescent anaesthesia
- Use of high-concentration compound local anaesthetic mixtures
- Inappropriate use of medical devices
- Administration at greater than recomended dose

### Prevention

1. **Availability of resuscitation equipment**
   - Regional blocks should always be performed in an area equipped to deal with cardiorespiratory collapse, such as an anaesthetic room or block room within the theatre suite
1. **Proper dosing**
   - Dosages should be adjusted according to the patient's age, weight and physical conditions
1. **Avoid drug mistakening**
   - Syringes of local anaeasthetic and perineural and epidural infusion should be labelled clearly.
1. **Reduce infection**
   - Use of premixed sterile solutions is encourged
1. **Incremental dosing**
   - Administer the local anaesthetic in small incremental doses rather than a single large dose
1. **Test Dose**
   - An appropriate test dose should be given depending on the situation
1. **Aspiration before injection**
   - Gentle aspiration of syringe before injection to avoid injection into the bloodstream
   - If there is blood in the syringe, withdraw and reposition the needle
1. **Monitoring**
   - Verbal contact with the patient must be maintained both during and after drug administration
1. **Ultrasound guidance**
   - Ultrasound can help visualize the needle placement and reduce risk of vascular puncture
