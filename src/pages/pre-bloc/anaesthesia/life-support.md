# Life Support

## Cardiac Arrest

> Cessation of normal circulation of blood due to failure of heart to contract effectively, which may be reversible by a rapid intervention but will be fetal without it

### Reversible Causes

1. Hypoxia
1. Hypothermia
1. Hypokalaemia or Hyperkalaemia
1. Hypovolaemia
1. Tamponade
1. Tension penumothorax
1. Thrombosis
1. Toxins

## Basic Life Support

- Series of actions performed on a critically ill person (cardiac arrest) aimed to buy time until emergency services
- Includes `Chest Compression` and `Rescue Breathing`
- Requires knowledge and skill to perform CPR and how to operate `automated external defibrillator (AED)`

### Chain of Survival

1. Recognition and activation of the **emergency response system**
1. Immediate high-quality **CPR**
1. Rapid **defibrillation**
1. Basic and advanced **emergency medical services**
1. **Advanced life support** and postarrest care

## Advanced Life Support

1. Start CPR
   - Airway adjuncts
   - Oxygens
   - Waveform capnography
   - IV/IO access
   - Plan actions before interrupting compressions (e.g., charge manual defibrillator)
1. Defibrillator/Monitor
1. Assess Rhythm
   1. If shockable
      - Shock
      - Drugs
        - Adrenaline 1 mg after 2nd shock (then every 2nd loop)
        - Amiodarone 300 mg after 3 shocks
      - CPR
   1. If non-shockable
      - CPR
      - Drugs
        - Adrenaline 1 mg immediately (then every 2nd loop)
1. Return of spontaneous circulation
1. Post resuscitation care
   - Re-evaluate ABCDE
   - 12 lead ECG
   - Treat precipitating causes
   - Aim for SpO2 94-98% normocapnia and normoglycaemia
   - Targeted temperature management
1. Consider and correct
   - Hypoxia
   - Hypothermia
   - Hypokalaemia or Hyperkalaemia
   - Hypovolaemia
   - Tamponade
   - Tension penumothorax
   - Thrombosis
   - Toxins
