# Oxygen Therapy

> Administering oxygen to patients (1) to maintain adequate oxygenation, (2) improving tissue oxygenation and (3) reducing the work of breathing.

## Indications for Oxygen Therapy

1. **Hypoxemia**: PaO₂ < 60 mmHg or SpO₂ < 90%.
1. **Acute Respiratory Distress**: Conditions like `pneumonia`, `pulmonary edema`, `acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)`, `asthma` exacerbations.
1. **Chronic Respiratory Conditions**: `Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)`, `interstitial lung disease`.
1. **Cardiac Conditions**: `Heart failure`, `myocardial infarction`.
1. **Perioperative Care**: Pre- and post-surgery to ensure adequate oxygenation.
1. **Severe Trauma**: To support oxygen delivery to vital organs.
1. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**: To displace CO from hemoglobin and restore oxygen transport.

## Complications

1. **Oxygen Toxicity**: Prolonged exposure to high oxygen concentrations (>60% FiO₂) can lead to lung injury.
1. **CO₂ Retention**: In patients with chronic CO₂ retention (e.g., COPD), excessive oxygen can suppress respiratory drive.
1. **Absorption Atelectasis**: High concentrations of oxygen can lead to nitrogen washout and collapse of alveoli.
1. **Drying of Mucous Membranes**: Prolonged use of oxygen can dry out nasal passages and airways.

### Selecting appropriate oxygen delivery devices

- Patient's comfort and acceptance
- Level of FiO2 needed
- Level of humidification
- Minimal resistance to breathing
- Efficient and economical use of oxygen

#### Nasal Cannula

- Flow Rate: 1-6 L/min
- FiO₂: 24-40%
- Uses:
  - Mild hypoxemia
  - Long-term oxygen therapy
  - Home care and ambulatory patients
- Advantages:
  - Comfortable, easy to use
  - Allows for eating, drinking, and talking
  - Suitable for stable patients with mild oxygen requirements

#### Simple Face Mask

- Flow Rate: 6-10 L/min
- FiO₂: 40-60%
- Uses:
  - Moderate hypoxemia
  - Postoperative recovery
  - Short-term oxygen therapy
- Advantages:
  - Higher FiO₂ than nasal cannula
  - Simple and easy to apply

#### Venturi Mask

- Flow Rate: Varies with adapter (usually 4-12 L/min)
- FiO₂: 24-50% (precise control)
- Uses:
  - COPD patients requiring precise oxygen delivery
  - Conditions needing specific and controlled FiO₂
- Advantages:
  - Accurate control of oxygen concentration
  - Reduces risk of CO₂ retention in COPD patients

#### Non-Rebreather Mask

- Flow Rate: 10-15 L/min
- FiO₂: 60-100%
- Uses:
  - Severe hypoxemia
  - Emergency situations (e.g., trauma, acute respiratory failure)
- Advantages:
  - Delivers high concentrations of oxygen
  - Has a reservoir bag to provide a higher FiO₂
  - One-way valves prevent rebreathing of exhaled air

#### High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)

- Flow Rate: Up to 60 L/min
- FiO₂: Up to 100%
- Uses:
  - Acute respiratory failure
  - Severe hypoxemia
  - Patients not tolerating non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
- Advantages:
  - High flow rates and precise FiO₂
  - Humidified and heated oxygen, improving comfort and mucociliary function
  - Can provide some degree of positive airway pressure

#### Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV)

- Devices: CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) and BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)
- Uses:
  - Acute exacerbations of COPD
  - Cardiogenic pulmonary edema
  - Sleep apnea
  - Respiratory failure where intubation can be avoided
- Advantages:
  - Provides positive pressure ventilation
  - Supports respiratory effort and improves gas exchange
  - Can reduce the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation

#### Mechanical Ventilation

- Uses:
  - Severe respiratory failure
  - Invasive airway management
  - During surgery and intensive care settings
- Advantages:
  - Complete control over FiO₂, tidal volume, and respiratory rate
  - Essential for life support in critically ill patients

## Monitoring and Adjusting Therapy

1. **Pulse Oximetry (SpO₂)**: Non-invasive monitoring of oxygen saturation.
1. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: Measures PaO₂, pCO₂, pH, HCO₃⁻ to assess oxygenation and ventilation.
1. **Clinical Assessment**: Regular monitoring of respiratory rate, effort, and mental status.

## Hypoxia

> Insufficient supply of oxygen to tissue or organs to meet their metabolic needs

### Different Types of Hypoxia

1. Hypoxic hypoxia
1. Anaemic hypoxia
1. Stagnant hypoxia (Circulatory hypoxia)
1. Histotoxic hypoxia

#### Hypoxic Hypoxia

> Inadequate oxygenation of blood in the lungs

- Best response to oxygen therapy
- Reduced partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) >>> Lower oxygen content in arterial blood.
- Causes:
  1. High altitude
  1. Hypoventilation
  1. Respiratory diseases (e.g., COPD, asthma, pneumonia)
  1. Airway obstruction.

#### Anemic Hypoxia

> Decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

- Reduced hemoglobin or abnormal hemoglobin >>> Decreased oxygen transport despite normal PaO₂.
- Causes:
  1. Anemia
  1. Carbon monoxide poisoning
  1. Methemoglobinemia

#### Circulatory (Stagnant) Hypoxia

> Inadequate blood flow to tissues.

- Inadequate tissue perfusion >>> Insufficient oxygen delivery to tissues.
- Causes:
  1. Heart failure
  1. Shock
  1. Arterial or venous obstruction

#### Histotoxic Hypoxia

> Cells are unable to utilize oxygen effectively.

- No response to oxygen therapy
- Cells cannot use oxygen, even though oxygen delivery may be adequate.
- Causes:
  1. Cyanide poisoning
  1. Certain metabolic poisons
