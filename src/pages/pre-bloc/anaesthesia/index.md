# Anaesthesia

## Types of Anaesthesia

1. Local Anaesthesia (LA)
1. Regional Anaesthesia (RA)
1. General Anaesthesia (GA)
1. Sedation

## 1. Local Anaesthesia (LA)

> Administration of anesthetic agents to a specific part of the body to block sensation, especially pain, in that localized area.

### Mechanism of Action [#LA]

- **Blockade of Sodium Channels**: Local anesthetics block voltage-gated sodium channels in the neuronal membrane, preventing the initiation and propagation of nerve impulses.
- **Reversible Inhibition**: The effect is reversible, allowing normal sensation to return after the drug wears off.

### Common Agents [#LA]

1. `Lidocaine`
1. `Bupivacaine`
1. `Ropivacaine`

### Uses [#LA]

- Minor surgical procedures (e.g., dental work, skin lesion removal)
- Diagnostic procedures (e.g., biopsies)

### Route [#LA]

1. Topical
1. Injection into the tissue (SC, IM)

### Contraindications

1. Allergy to LA
1. Infection at the injection site
1. Bleeding disorders (e.g. Haemophilia, Thrombocytopenia)
1. Neurological disorders (e.g. Multiple sclerosis, Peripheral neuropathies)

## 2. Regional Anaesthesia (RA)

> Blocks sensation in a larger part of the body by targeting specific nerves or spinal segments, without affecting consciousness

### Types of RA

1. **Spinal(Intrathecal) Anaesthesia**: Injection into the subarachnoid space in the lumbar region, affecting lower body areas.
1. **Epidural Anaesthesia**: Injection into the epidural space, often used during childbirth and lower limb surgeries.
1. **Peripheral Nerve Blocks**: Targeting specific nerve clusters to anesthetize a limb or specific area.

### Mechanism of Action [#RA]

- Similar to local anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia involves the blockade of sodium channels in nerve fibers.

### Uses [#RA]

- Surgeries of the lower limbs, abdomen, pelvis
- Pain management during labor and delivery

### Routes [#RA]

![Epidural Space](/anaesthesia/epidural.jpg)

1. Epidural: Injection into the epidural space
1. Spinal: Injection into the intrathecal space
1. Peripheral nerve block: Injection around nerves supplying the target area

### Side Effects [#RA]

- Hypotension
- Headache (with spinal/epidural)
- Nerve damage
- Infection

### Contraindications [#RA]

- Same as LA

### Dosage [#RA]

- Tailored to patient's weight, age and specific procedure

## 3. General Anaesthesia (GA)

> Induces a reversible state of unconsciousness (amnesia), analgesia, and muscle relaxation for the duration of a surgical procedure.

### Mechanism of Action [#GA]

- **Central Nervous System Depression**: A combination of intravenous and inhaled agents depress the central nervous system to achieve unconsciousness and analgesia.
  - **Inhalation Agents**: Such as `sevoflurane`, `isoflurane`, and `desflurane`.
  - **Intravenous Agents**: Such as `propofol`, `etomidate`, and `ketamine`.

### Phases [#GA]

- **Induction**: Administration of anesthetic agents to induce unconsciousness.
- **Maintenance**: Continuation of anesthetic agents to maintain unconsciousness and analgesia.
- **Emergence**: Gradual cessation of anesthetic agents to allow the patient to regain consciousness.

### Uses [#GA]

- Major surgeries (e.g., cardiac, thoracic, abdominal surgeries)
- Procedures requiring complete muscle relaxation and immobility

### Routes [#GA]

- IV or Inhalation

### Side Effects [#GA]

- Nausea, Vomiting, Dizziness
- Sore throat
- Muscle ache
- Shivering
- Confusion

### Contraindication [#GA]

- Allergy to GA
- Severe CVS diseases (e.g. Uncontrolled hypertension, Severe heart failure, Unstable angina)
- Respiratory insufficiency or obstruction (e.g. COPD, Severe asthma, Obstructive sleep apnea)
- Malignant hyperthermia Susceptibility (Rare but life-threatening pharmacogenetic disorder)
- Uncontrolled systemic infections

## 4. Sedation

> A state of calm or sleepiness that reduces anxiety and discomfort, often used in combination with local or regional anaesthesia.

### Levels

- **Minimal Sedation**: Patient remains awake but relaxed.
- **Moderate Sedation**: Patient may sleep but can respond to verbal stimuli.
- **Deep Sedation**: Patient is asleep and responds only to painful stimuli.

### Common Agents [#S]

1. `Midazolam`
1. `Propofol`
1. `Fentanyl`

### Uses [#S]

- Diagnostic procedures (e.g., endoscopy, colonoscopy)
- Minor surgical procedures
- Safety and Monitoring

### Routes [#S]

1. IV
1. Oral
1. Inhalation

### Side Effects [#S]

- Respiratory depression
- Hypotension
- Nausea, Dizziness, Confusion

### Contraindications [#S]

- Severe heart or lung disease
- Allergy to drugs

## Preoperative Assessment

Comprehensive evaluation of patientâ€™s medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to identify potential risks.

## Intraoperative Monitoring

- **Vital Signs**: Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Includes electrocardiography (ECG), capnography, and neuromuscular function monitoring.

## Postoperative Care

- **Recovery Room**: Patients are closely monitored for any immediate complications or adverse effects.
- **Pain Management**: Use of analgesics and other medications to manage postoperative pain.
