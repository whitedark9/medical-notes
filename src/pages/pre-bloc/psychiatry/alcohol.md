# Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)

> Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a medical condition characterized by an inability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences.

It encompasses a range of behaviors and physical symptoms, including dependence and abuse.

## Clinical Features

### General Features

- **Craving**: Strong urge or desire to drink alcohol.
- **Loss of control**: Inability to limit drinking on any given occasion.
- **Physical dependence**: Withdrawal symptoms when not drinking.
- **Tolerance**: Need to drink greater amounts of alcohol to achieve the same effect.

### Withdrawal Symptoms

- **Mild Symptoms**:
  - Anxiety
  - Tremors
  - Sweating
  - Nausea
  - Insomnia
- **Moderate to Severe Symptoms**:
  - Hallucinations (visual, auditory, or tactile)
  - Seizures
  - Delirium tremens (DTs): Confusion, rapid heartbeat, and high blood pressure

### Alcohol-Related Problems

- **Health Problems**: Liver disease (cirrhosis), pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and increased risk of cancer.
- **Psychiatric Problems**: Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and other mental health disorders.
- **Social Problems**: Family conflicts, job loss, legal issues, financial difficulties, and impaired relationships.
- **Risky Behaviors**: Drunk driving, unprotected sex, and violence.

## Diagnostic Criteria

### DSM-5 Criteria for AUD

A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following within a 12-month period:

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended.
2. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.
3. A great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from alcohol.
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.
5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.
6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use.
8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.
9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either:
    - A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
    - A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.
11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either:
    - The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol.
    - Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Substance Use Disorders**: Differentiate from other substance use disorders (e.g., opioid use disorder, stimulant use disorder) based on the specific substance used.
- **Mood Disorders**: Depression, bipolar disorder – symptoms of these disorders can overlap with AUD.
- **Anxiety Disorders**: Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder – alcohol may be used to self-medicate.
- **Personality Disorders**: Borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder – may exhibit behaviors that overlap with AUD.
- **Medical Conditions**: Conditions like hepatic encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte disturbances that can mimic alcohol intoxication or withdrawal symptoms.
- **Other Psychiatric Disorders**: Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder – hallucinations and other symptoms can overlap with alcohol withdrawal or intoxication.

# Complications and Management of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)

## Complications

### Physical Complications

- **Liver Disease**: Fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis.
- **Gastrointestinal Issues**: Gastritis, pancreatitis, esophageal varices.
- **Cardiovascular Problems**: Hypertension, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias.
- **Neurological Issues**: Peripheral neuropathy, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, seizures.
- **Immune System**: Weakened immune response, increased susceptibility to infections.
- **Cancer**: Increased risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, colon, and breast.
- **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, particularly thiamine (B1).

### Psychological Complications

- **Legal Issues**: DUI charges, domestic violence, criminal behavior.

## Management

### Acute Management

- **Withdrawal Management**
  - **`Benzodiazepines`**: First-line treatment for preventing and treating withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
  - **Nutritional Support**: `Thiamine`, `folate`, and `multivitamin supplements` to prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
  - **Hydration and Electrolyte Correction**: IV fluids to manage dehydration and correct electrolyte imbalances.

### Long-Term Management

- **Psychosocial Interventions**

  - **Motivational Interviewing**: Helps individuals recognize and commit to behavior change.
  - **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Addresses maladaptive thinking patterns and behaviors associated with alcohol use.
  - **Group Therapy**: Support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) provide peer support and accountability.
  - **Family Therapy**: Involves family members to improve relationships and support recovery.

- **Pharmacotherapy**

  - **Disulfiram**: Causes unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, acting as a deterrent.
  - **Naltrexone**: Reduces cravings and the rewarding effects of alcohol.
  - **Acamprosate**: Helps maintain abstinence by reducing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Lifestyle Modifications**
  - **Healthy Diet**: Ensures adequate nutrition and addresses deficiencies.
  - **Regular Exercise**: Promotes physical and mental well-being.
  - **Stress Management**: Techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation exercises.

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Regular Assessments**: Monitor liver function tests, electrolytes, and overall health.
- **Continued Support**: Ongoing therapy and support groups to maintain sobriety.
- **Relapse Prevention**: Identify triggers and develop coping strategies to prevent relapse.
