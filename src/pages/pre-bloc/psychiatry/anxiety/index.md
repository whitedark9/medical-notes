# Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

> A chronic mental health condition characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various aspects of life, such as personal health, work, social interactions, and everyday routine life circumstances.

This worry is persistent and often disproportionate to the actual situation.

## Clinical Features

- **Persistent and excessive worry**
- **Physical symptoms**:
  - Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
  - Being easily fatigued
  - Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank

## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

1. **Excessive anxiety and worry** (apprehensive expectation)
   - occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities.
2. **Difficulty controlling the worry**
3. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months):

   - Being easily fatigued
   - Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank

4. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
5. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
