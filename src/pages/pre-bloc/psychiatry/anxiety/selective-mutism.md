# Selective Mutism

> A complex childhood anxiety disorder characterized by a child's inability to speak in certain social situations where there is an expectation to speak, despite speaking in other settings.

This condition is often first noticed in school settings.

## Clinical Features

- **Consistent Failure to Speak**: In specific social situations (e.g., at school or with playmates) where speaking is expected, despite speaking in other situations (e.g., at home with family).
- **Interference with Functioning**: The inability to speak interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.
- **Duration**: The failure to speak is not limited to the first month of school (or the first month in a new social environment) and lasts at least 1 month.
- **Not Due to Lack of Knowledge**: The failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.
- **Not Better Explained**: The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.

## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

1. Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations where there is an expectation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.
2. The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.
3. The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school).
4. The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation.
5. The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Communication Disorders**: Such as childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering).
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder**
- **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)**
- **Intellectual Disability**
- **Trauma-related Disorders**

## Management

### Behavioral Therapy

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Focused on reducing anxiety and gradually increasing speech in social situations.
- **Behavioral Techniques**: Such as positive reinforcement, shaping, and exposure therapy to encourage speech in various settings.
- **Social Skills Training**: To help the child become more comfortable in social interactions.

### Family Therapy

- **Parental Involvement**: Training parents to support and reinforce the childâ€™s efforts to speak.
- **Family Education**: Educating the family about the disorder and strategies to manage it at home.

### School-based Interventions

- **Individualized Education Plan (IEP)**: Development of an IEP to provide support within the school setting.
- **Collaborative Approach**: Involving teachers, school counselors, and psychologists to create a supportive environment.

### Pharmacotherapy

- **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Considered in severe cases or when there is comorbid anxiety disorder (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline).
- **Cautions**: Medications should be used with caution and typically as an adjunct to behavioral therapy.

### Follow-up and Monitoring

- Regular follow-up to monitor progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- Continuous support and reinforcement in various social settings.
