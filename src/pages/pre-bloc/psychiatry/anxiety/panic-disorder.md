# Panic Disorder

> Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and persistent concern about having more attacks or their implications.

A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and includes a variety of physical and cognitive symptoms.

## Clinical Features

- **Panic Attacks**: Recurrent and unexpected episodes of intense fear or discomfort, including at least four of the following symptoms:
  - Palpitations or rapid heart rate
  - Sweating
  - Trembling or shaking
  - Shortness of breath or sensation of smothering
  - Feelings of choking
  - Chest pain or discomfort
  - Nausea or abdominal distress
  - Dizziness, lightheadedness, or feeling faint
  - Chills or heat sensations
  - Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)
  - Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)
  - Fear of losing control or "going crazy"
  - Fear of dying
- **Persistent Concern or Behavioral Changes**: At least one month of persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences, or significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., avoidance of situations where panic attacks have occurred).

## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

1. **Recurrent unexpected panic attacks**: At least one of the attacks has been followed by one month (or more) of one or both of the following:

   - Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences.
   - Significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).

2. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).

3. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or separation anxiety disorder).

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**
- **Social Anxiety Disorder**
- **Specific Phobias**
- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**
- **Major Depressive Disorder**
- **Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder**
- **Anxiety Disorder due to another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease)**

## Management

### Psychotherapy

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: First-line treatment, particularly effective in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks.
  - Focuses on changing maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.
  - Includes exposure therapy to desensitize patients to panic-inducing stimuli.

### Pharmacotherapy

- **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: First-line pharmacological treatment.
  - Examples: Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine
- **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Alternative to SSRIs.
  - Examples: Venlafaxine
- **Benzodiazepines**: Short-term use for acute panic attacks.
  - Examples: Alprazolam, Lorazepam
  - Caution: Risk of dependence and withdrawal; not recommended for long-term use.
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**: Used if SSRIs and SNRIs are not effective.
  - Examples: Imipramine, Clomipramine
- **Beta-Blockers**: Occasionally used to manage physical symptoms of anxiety.
  - Examples: Propranolol

### Lifestyle and Supportive Measures

- **Regular Exercise**: Can help reduce anxiety levels.
- **Healthy Diet**: Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which can exacerbate anxiety.
- **Adequate Sleep**: Maintaining a regular sleep schedule.
- **Stress Management Techniques**: Yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises.
- **Support Groups**: Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide comfort and advice.

## Follow-up

- **Regular follow-up appointments** to monitor progress and adjust treatment plans as necessary.
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about the nature of the disorder and the importance of adherence to treatment.
