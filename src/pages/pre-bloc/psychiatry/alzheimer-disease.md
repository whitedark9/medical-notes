# Alzheimer's Disease

> Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults.

## Pathophysiology

- **Amyloid Plaques**: Extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid peptides leading to neuronal toxicity.
- **Neurofibrillary Tangles**: Intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein causing microtubule disintegration.
- **Neuronal Loss**: Significant loss of neurons, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex.
- **Cholinergic Dysfunction**: Decreased acetylcholine levels due to loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain.
- **Inflammation**: Chronic neuroinflammation contributing to neuronal damage.
- **Genetic Factors**: Mutations in genes such as APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2; presence of APOE Îµ4 allele increases risk.

## Clinical Features

- **Cognitive Decline**: Progressive memory loss, difficulty in problem-solving, confusion about time or place.
- **Language Problems**: Difficulty finding words, reduced vocabulary.
- **Visuospatial Issues**: Difficulty with spatial relationships, becoming lost in familiar places.
- **Executive Dysfunction**: Poor judgment, difficulty planning and completing tasks.
- **Behavioral Changes**: Mood swings, apathy, withdrawal, irritability, depression.
- **Advanced Symptoms**: Severe memory loss, inability to recognize loved ones, complete dependency on caregivers.

## Investigation

- **History and Physical Examination**: Detailed clinical history, mental status examination.
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT scan to rule out other causes of dementia, evaluate brain atrophy.
- **Cognitive Testing**: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
- **Biomarkers**: CSF analysis for beta-amyloid and tau levels, PET scans for amyloid and tau imaging.
- **Genetic Testing**: In selected cases, particularly for early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease.

## Management

- **Non-Pharmacological**:
  - **Cognitive Rehabilitation**: Memory training, cognitive stimulation.
  - **Behavioral Interventions**: Structured routines, environmental modifications.
  - **Supportive Care**: Education and support for caregivers, community resources.
  - **Lifestyle Modifications**: Physical exercise, healthy diet, social engagement.
- **Pharmacological**:
  - **Cholinesterase Inhibitors**: Donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine to increase acetylcholine levels.
  - **NMDA Receptor Antagonist**: Memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.
  - **Adjunctive Therapies**: Antidepressants for depression, antipsychotics for severe agitation (use cautiously).
- **Emerging Therapies**:

  - **Disease-Modifying Treatments**: Investigational drugs targeting amyloid and tau proteins.
  - **Monoclonal Antibodies**: Aducanumab (controversial, requires further research).

- **Follow-up**:
  - **Regular Monitoring**: Assess cognitive and functional status, adjust treatments as needed.
  - **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Coordination among neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care providers, and support services.
