These mood episodes can affect an individual's energy levels, activity, sleep patterns, behavior, and ability to function in daily life.

## Types of Bipolar Disorder

### Bipolar I Disorder

Defined by the occurrence of at least one manic episode, which may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.

### Bipolar II Disorder

Characterized by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but no full-blown manic episodes.

### Cyclothymic Disorder

Periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years, without meeting the full criteria for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode.

## Clinical Features

- **Mood Episodes**: Periods of mania, hypomania, or depression.
  - **Manic Episode**: Elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, grandiosity, talkativeness, racing thoughts, distractibility, increased goal-directed activities, risky behaviors.
