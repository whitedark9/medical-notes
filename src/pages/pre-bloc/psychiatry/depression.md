# Depression

> Depression (Major Depressive Disorder) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and a range of emotional and physical symptoms that interfere with daily functioning.

## Pathophysiology

- **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**: Dysregulation of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
- **Neuroendocrine Factors**: Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to elevated cortisol levels.
- **Genetic Factors**: Genetic predisposition with multiple genes implicated.
- **Neuroplasticity**: Decreased synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
- **Inflammation**: Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines.
- **Psychosocial Factors**: Stressful life events, early childhood adversity, and chronic stress.

## Clinical Features

- **Emotional Symptoms**:

  - **Persistent Sadness**: Feeling sad or empty most of the day, nearly every day.
  - **Anhedonia**: Loss of interest or pleasure in most activities.
  - **Guilt or Worthlessness**: Excessive or inappropriate feelings of guilt or worthlessness.

- **Cognitive Symptoms**:

  - **Concentration Problems**: Difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.
  - **Indecisiveness**: Difficulty making decisions.

- **Physical Symptoms**:

  - **Fatigue**: Chronic tiredness or lack of energy.
  - **Sleep Disturbances**: Insomnia or hypersomnia.
  - **Appetite Changes**: Significant weight loss or gain due to changes in appetite.
  - **Psychomotor Changes**: Agitation or retardation observable by others.

- **Suicidal Ideation**: Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

## Investigation

- **Clinical Assessment**: Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, including history and mental status examination.
- **Diagnostic Criteria**: DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria.
- **Rating Scales**: PHQ-9, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) for assessing severity.
- **Laboratory Tests**: To rule out medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, anemia, or electrolyte imbalances.
- **Neuroimaging**: In certain cases, to exclude neurological disorders.

## Management

- **Pharmacological**:

  - **Antidepressants**:
    - **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: Fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram.
    - **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**: Venlafaxine, duloxetine.
    - **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**: Amitriptyline, nortriptyline.
    - **Atypical Antidepressants**: Bupropion, mirtazapine.
    - **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)**: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine (less commonly used).
  - **Adjunctive Therapies**: Atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers for treatment-resistant cases.

- **Non-Pharmacological**:

  - **Psychotherapy**:
    - **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Evidence-based therapy focusing on changing negative thought patterns.
    - **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**: Focuses on improving interpersonal relationships and communication.
    - **Psychodynamic Therapy**: Explores past experiences and emotional conflicts.
  - **Lifestyle Modifications**: Regular exercise, healthy diet, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques.
  - **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), yoga, meditation.

- **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**: For severe depression not responding to other treatments.
- **Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)**: Non-invasive brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.

- **Follow-up**:
  - **Regular Monitoring**: Assess symptom severity, medication adherence, and side effects.
  - **Long-term Maintenance**: Preventing relapse with ongoing treatment and support.
