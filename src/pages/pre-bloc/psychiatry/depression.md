## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

A diagnosis of MDD requires the presence of five (or more) of the following symptoms during the same 2-week period; at least one of the symptoms must be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure:

1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease/increase in appetite
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day
7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
9. Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide

These symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning and cannot be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Bipolar Disorder**: Characterized by mood swings that include both depressive and manic/hypomanic episodes.
- **Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder)**: Chronic form of depression with less severe symptoms lasting for at least two years.
- **Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood**: Depressive symptoms occurring in response to a significant life stressor.
- **Substance-Induced Mood Disorder**: Depression related to the use of drugs or withdrawal from substances.
- **Depressive Disorder due to Another Medical Condition**: Depression caused by medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, or stroke.
- **Grief**: Normal reaction to loss, characterized by sadness but generally not associated with significant impairment or pervasive feelings of worthlessness.

## Complications

- **Suicidal Ideation and Behavior**
- **Self-Harm**
- **Substance Abuse**
- **Social Isolation**
- **Poor Occupational Functioning**
- **Physical Health Issues**
- **Comorbid Mental Health Disorders**
- **Impaired Daily Functioning**
- **Cognitive Impairment**

## Management

### Pharmacotherapy

- **Antidepressants**:
  - **SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)**
    - `Fluoxetine`, `sertraline`, `citalopram`
    - **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft.
    - ~~Side Effects~~: Nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, weight gain.
  - **SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)**
    - `Venlafaxine`, `duloxetine`.
    - **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine.
    - ~~Side Effects~~: Hypertension, nausea, dry mouth.
  - **TCAs (Tricyclic Antidepressants)**
    - `Amitriptyline`, `nortriptyline`.
    - **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.
    - ~~Side Effects~~: Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, cardiac toxicity.
  - **MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)**
    - `Phenelzine`, `tranylcypromine`.
    - **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase, preventing the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters.
    - ~~Side Effects~~: Dietary restrictions (tyramine), hypertensive crisis, orthostatic hypotension.

### Psychotherapy

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**:
  - Focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors.
  - Effective in both individual and group settings.
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)**:
  - Addresses interpersonal issues and aims to improve communication skills and relationships.
- **Psychodynamic Therapy**:
  - Explores past experiences and unconscious processes influencing current behavior.
- **Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)**:
  - Combines cognitive therapy with mindfulness strategies to prevent relapse.

### Lifestyle Modifications

- **Regular Physical Activity**
- **Healthy Diet**
- **Adequate Sleep**
- **Stress Management**

### Other Treatments

- **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**:
  - Used for severe depression that is resistant to other treatments.
  - Involves electrical stimulation of the brain under general anesthesia.
- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)**:
  - Non-invasive procedure using magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain.
- **Light Therapy**:
  - Particularly effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

### Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Regular Appointments**:
  - Frequent follow-up visits to monitor progress, medication side effects, and overall well-being.
- **Screening for Suicidal Ideation**:
  - Regular assessment of suicide risk and implementation of safety plans if necessary.
- **Support Systems**:
  - Encouraging the involvement of family and friends for additional support.

### Education and Self-Help

- **Patient Education**:
  - Providing information about the nature of the disorder and treatment options.
- **Support Groups**:
  - Peer support groups to share experiences and coping strategies.
