## Aetiology

### Biological Factors

- **Genetics**:
  - Family history of mental disorders can increase risk.
  - Specific genetic variations and mutations linked to disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
- **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**:
  - Dysregulation of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA can contribute to disorders such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.
- **Brain Structure and Function**:
  - Abnormalities in brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, hippocampus) and connectivity may be involved in mental illnesses.
  - Neuroimaging studies show structural and functional changes in patients with mental disorders.
- **Hormonal Imbalance**:
  - Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can lead to stress-related disorders like depression and anxiety.

### Psychological Factors

- **Early Childhood Experiences**:
  - Trauma, abuse, and neglect during childhood can increase the risk of developing mental disorders.
  - Insecure attachment styles may contribute to emotional and behavioral issues.
- **Personality Traits**:
  - Certain personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, introversion) can predispose individuals to mental health issues.
- **Cognitive Patterns**:
  - Maladaptive thinking patterns, such as negative self-talk and rumination, can exacerbate or contribute to disorders like depression and anxiety.

### Environmental Factors

- **Stressful Life Events**:
  - Major life changes, trauma, and chronic stress can trigger mental health issues.
- **Socioeconomic Status**:
  - Poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education and healthcare can contribute to the development of mental disorders.
- **Social Support**:
  - Lack of social support and isolation can increase vulnerability to mental health problems.
- **Substance Abuse**:
  - Alcohol and drug abuse can lead to or exacerbate mental health disorders.

### Cultural Factors

- **Cultural Beliefs and Stigma**:
  - Cultural attitudes toward mental health can influence the expression and recognition of symptoms.
  - Stigma associated with mental illness may prevent individuals from seeking help.
- **Acculturation**:
  - The process of adapting to a new culture can be stressful and may contribute to mental health issues, especially in immigrant populations.

### Genetic-Environmental Interaction

- **Gene-Environment Interaction**:
  - Certain genetic predispositions may be activated or exacerbated by environmental factors.
  - Examples include the interaction between genetic vulnerability to depression and exposure to stressful life events.

## Terminology

### Delirium

> Delirium is an acute, fluctuating state of confusion characterized by disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognition. It often develops rapidly and is typically a temporary condition.

### Hallucination

> A hallucination is a false sensory perception that occurs without an external stimulus. It is a vivid perception that seems real but is created by the mind.

#### Examples:

- **Auditory Hallucination**: Hearing voices when no one is speaking.
- **Visual Hallucination**: Seeing objects or people that are not present.
- **Tactile Hallucination**: Feeling sensations on the skin (e.g., bugs crawling) without any physical cause.

### Illusion

> An illusion is a distorted or misleading perception of a real external stimulus. Unlike hallucinations, illusions are based on real external stimuli but are misinterpreted by the brain.

#### Examples:

- **Optical Illusion**: Misinterpreting a stick submerged in water as bent due to light refraction.
- **Auditory Illusion**: Hearing a sound and misinterpreting its source or nature, like mistaking the rustling of leaves for whispering voices.

### Delusion

> A delusion is a firmly held false belief that is resistant to reason or confrontation with actual facts. It is a fixed, false belief that does not change even when presented with evidence to the contrary.

#### Examples:

- **Paranoid Delusion**: Believing that one is being persecuted or conspired against without any proof.
- **Grandiose Delusion**: Believing that one has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame despite clear evidence to the contrary.
- **Somatic Delusion**: Believing that one has a physical illness or defect when no medical condition is present.
