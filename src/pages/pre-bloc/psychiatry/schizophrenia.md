# Schizophrenia

<<<<<<< HEAD
> A chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by distorted thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. It often presents with episodes of psychosis including `hallucinations` and `delusions`.

## Clinical Features

### Positive Symptoms

- **Hallucinations**: Typically auditory, but can also be visual, olfactory, or tactile.
- **Delusions**: Fixed, false beliefs that are not consistent with reality, often paranoid or grandiose. [^1]
- **Disorganized Speech**: Incoherent or nonsensical speech patterns.
- **Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior**: Unpredictable or inappropriate behavior, lack of movement or response to stimuli.

[^1]: **Grandiose**: impressive and imposing in appearance or style, especially pretentiously so

### Negative Symptoms

- **Affective Flattening**: Reduced expression of emotions.
- **Alogia**: Poverty of speech.
- **Anhedonia**: Inability to experience pleasure.
- **Avolition**: Lack of motivation to initiate or sustain goal-directed activities.

### Cognitive [^2] Symptoms

- **Impaired Executive Function**: Difficulty with planning, organizing, and abstract thinking.
- **Attention Deficits**: Problems with focusing and sustaining attention.
- **Memory Impairments**: Difficulties with working memory and long-term memory.

[^2]: **Cognition**: the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.

## Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

### Criterion A

Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (at least one must be 1, 2, or 3):

1. `Delusions`
1. `Hallucinations`
1. `Disorganized speech`
1. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
1. Negative symptoms

### Criterion B

For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.

### Criterion C

Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for **at least 6 months**. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A.

### Criterion D

Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out.

### Criterion E

The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

### Criterion F

If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Schizoaffective Disorder**: Presence of mood disorder symptoms in addition to schizophrenia symptoms.
- **Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during mood episodes.
- **Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features**: Psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during depressive episodes.
- **Substance-Induced Psychotic Disorder**: Symptoms are attributable to substance use or withdrawal.
- **Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: Symptoms are attributable to a medical condition (e.g., brain tumor, epilepsy).
- **Delusional Disorder**: Presence of delusions without other symptoms of schizophrenia.
- **Brief Psychotic Disorder**: Symptoms last for less than one month.
- **Autism Spectrum Disorder**: Overlapping features, especially in communication and behavior, but lack of prominent psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions.

## Management

### Pharmacological Treatment

#### Antipsychotic Medications

- **First-Generation Antipsychotics (Typical)**:
  - Examples: `Haloperidol`, `Chlorpromazine`
  - Mechanism: Dopamine D2 receptor antagonism
  - Side Effects: Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) [^3], tardive dyskinesia [^4], sedation, anticholinergic effects
- **Second-Generation Antipsychotics (Atypical)**:
  - Examples: `Risperidone`, `Olanzapine`, `Clozapine`, `Quetiapine`, `Aripiprazole`
  - Mechanism: Dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism
  - Side Effects: Metabolic syndrome, weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia, lower risk of EPS

[^3]: **EPS**: drug-induced movement disorders
[^4]: **Tardive Dyskinesia**: A late-onset EPS characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements, often of the face, lips, tongue, and extremities.

#### Clozapine

- Used for **treatment-resistant schizophrenia**
- Requires regular monitoring of white blood cell count due to risk of agranulocytosis
- Other side effects: Seizures, myocarditis, sialorrhea

#### Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotics

- Used for patients with poor medication adherence
- Examples: `Risperidone LAI`, `Paliperidone palmitate`, `Aripiprazole LAI`

### Psychosocial Interventions

1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
2. Psychoeducation
3. Family Therapy
4. Social Skills Training
5. Supported Employment and Education

### Community-Based Services

#### Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)

- Multidisciplinary team approach providing comprehensive, individualized care
- Includes case management, medication management, and psychosocial support
- Reduces hospitalization rates and improves quality of life

#### Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)

- Comprehensive, team-based approach for early intervention in first-episode psychosis
- Includes medication management, psychotherapy, family education, and support

### Hospitalization

#### Indications

- Acute psychotic episodes
- Severe symptoms that pose a risk to self or others
- Inability to care for oneself

### Lifestyle and Supportive Measures

1. Healthy Lifestyle Choices
2. Peer Support
3. Regular Monitoring

=======
> Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by distorted thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. It often presents with episodes of psychosis including hallucinations and delusions.

## Pathophysiology

- **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**: Dysregulation of dopamine pathways (increased dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway and decreased activity in the mesocortical pathway). Other neurotransmitters like glutamate and serotonin also play roles.
- **Genetic Factors**: High heritability; multiple genes implicated including COMT, DISC1, and NRG1.
- **Structural Brain Abnormalities**: Enlargement of lateral and third ventricles, reduced size of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus.
- **Neurodevelopmental Hypothesis**: Abnormal brain development during early life leading to structural and functional brain changes.
- **Environmental Factors**: Prenatal infections, malnutrition, obstetric complications, psychosocial stressors.

## Clinical Features

- **Positive Symptoms**:

  - **Hallucinations**: Most commonly auditory.
  - **Delusions**: False beliefs, often paranoid or grandiose.
  - **Disorganized Speech**: Incoherence, tangentiality.
  - **Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior**: Unpredictable agitation, bizarre postures.

- **Negative Symptoms**:

  - **Affective Flattening**: Reduced emotional expression.
  - **Alogia**: Poverty of speech.
  - **Anhedonia**: Inability to experience pleasure.
  - **Avolition**: Lack of motivation.

- **Cognitive Symptoms**:
  - **Impaired Executive Function**: Difficulty with planning, organizing.
  - **Attention Deficits**: Trouble concentrating.
  - **Memory Problems**: Working memory deficits.

## Investigation

- **Clinical Assessment**: Detailed psychiatric evaluation including history, mental status examination.
- **Diagnostic Criteria**: DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria.
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT to rule out other causes of psychosis.
- **Laboratory Tests**: To exclude medical conditions or substance-induced psychosis.
- **Cognitive Testing**: Assessments to evaluate cognitive function.
- **Genetic Testing**: In research settings or familial cases.

## Management

- **Pharmacological**:
  - **Antipsychotics**:
    - **First-Generation (Typical)**: Haloperidol, chlorpromazine.
    - **Second-Generation (Atypical)**: Risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole.
  - **Side Effects Management**: Monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic syndrome.
- **Non-Pharmacological**:
  - **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive therapy.
  - **Psychoeducation**: Education for patients and families about the disease and management.
