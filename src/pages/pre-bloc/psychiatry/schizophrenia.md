# Schizophrenia

> Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by distorted thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self, and behavior. It often presents with episodes of psychosis including hallucinations and delusions.

## Pathophysiology

- **Neurotransmitter Imbalance**: Dysregulation of dopamine pathways (increased dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway and decreased activity in the mesocortical pathway). Other neurotransmitters like glutamate and serotonin also play roles.
- **Genetic Factors**: High heritability; multiple genes implicated including COMT, DISC1, and NRG1.
- **Structural Brain Abnormalities**: Enlargement of lateral and third ventricles, reduced size of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus.
- **Neurodevelopmental Hypothesis**: Abnormal brain development during early life leading to structural and functional brain changes.
- **Environmental Factors**: Prenatal infections, malnutrition, obstetric complications, psychosocial stressors.

## Clinical Features

- **Positive Symptoms**:

  - **Hallucinations**: Most commonly auditory.
  - **Delusions**: False beliefs, often paranoid or grandiose.
  - **Disorganized Speech**: Incoherence, tangentiality.
  - **Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior**: Unpredictable agitation, bizarre postures.

- **Negative Symptoms**:

  - **Affective Flattening**: Reduced emotional expression.
  - **Alogia**: Poverty of speech.
  - **Anhedonia**: Inability to experience pleasure.
  - **Avolition**: Lack of motivation.

- **Cognitive Symptoms**:
  - **Impaired Executive Function**: Difficulty with planning, organizing.
  - **Attention Deficits**: Trouble concentrating.
  - **Memory Problems**: Working memory deficits.

## Investigation

- **Clinical Assessment**: Detailed psychiatric evaluation including history, mental status examination.
- **Diagnostic Criteria**: DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria.
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT to rule out other causes of psychosis.
- **Laboratory Tests**: To exclude medical conditions or substance-induced psychosis.
- **Cognitive Testing**: Assessments to evaluate cognitive function.
- **Genetic Testing**: In research settings or familial cases.

## Management

- **Pharmacological**:
  - **Antipsychotics**:
    - **First-Generation (Typical)**: Haloperidol, chlorpromazine.
    - **Second-Generation (Atypical)**: Risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole.
  - **Side Effects Management**: Monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic syndrome.
- **Non-Pharmacological**:
  - **Psychotherapy**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive therapy.
  - **Psychoeducation**: Education for patients and families about the disease and management.
  - **Social Skills Training**: Improving social interactions and daily living skills.
  - **Vocational Rehabilitation**: Support for employment and occupational functioning.
- **Community and Support Services**:
  - **Case Management**: Coordination of care.
  - **Peer Support**: Support groups and peer networks.
  - **Family Support**: Family therapy, education, and support services.
- **Hospitalization**: For acute episodes or if there's a risk of harm to self or others.

- **Long-term Management**:
  - **Regular Follow-up**: Monitoring of symptoms, medication adherence, and side effects.
  - **Relapse Prevention**: Identifying and managing early warning signs.
