# Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMCT) of HIV

## Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for Pregnant Women

- **Preferred Regimens**:
  - **`Tenofovir` disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + `Emtricitabine` (FTC) + `Efavirenz` (EFV)**
  - **`TDF` + `Lamivudine` (3TC) + `EFV`**
- **Alternative Regimens**:
  - **`Abacavir` (ABC) + `3TC` + `EFV`**
  - **`Zidovudine` (AZT) + `3TC` + `EFV`**
  - **`AZT` + `3TC` + `Lopinavir/ritonavir` (LPV/r)**
- **Considerations**:
  - Start as early as possible during pregnancy.
  - Adjust regimen based on resistance patterns and tolerance.

## Safe Delivery Practices

- **Cesarean Section**:
  - Recommended for mothers with high viral loads.
- **Vaginal Delivery**:
  - Possible with undetectable viral load.
  - Avoid invasive procedures (e.g., episiotomy, artificial rupture of membranes).

## Feeding Options

- **Exclusive Breastfeeding**:
  - Recommended in settings where formula feeding is not safe.
  - Continue maternal ART and infant prophylaxis during breastfeeding.
- **Formula Feeding**:
  - Preferred if safe, feasible, affordable, and sustainable.
  - Discontinue breastfeeding to avoid mixed feeding risks.

## Managing the Baby

### Antiretroviral Prophylaxis

- **For All Infants**:
  - **Birth to 4-6 weeks**: `Zidovudine` (AZT) or `Nevirapine` (NVP)
- **High-Risk Infants** (e.g., maternal viral load >1000 copies/mL):
  - **Birth to 6 weeks**: Combination of `AZT` and `NVP or AZT` and `3TC` plus `NVP`.

### Infant Testing and Monitoring

- **At Birth**:
  - PCR test for HIV RNA/DNA.
- **At 4-6 Weeks**:
  - Repeat PCR test.
- **After Breastfeeding Ends**:
  - Final PCR test 6 weeks after breastfeeding cessation.
- **At 18 Months**:
  - HIV serological testing to confirm HIV status.

## Additional Care and Follow-Up

- **Regular Pediatric Care**:
  - Monitor growth and development.
  - Routine immunizations.
- **Counseling and Support**:
  - Educate mothers on ART adherence.
  - Promote safe feeding practices.
  - Provide psychological and social support.

## Overall PMTCT Program Components

- **Primary Prevention**:
  - Prevent HIV infection in women of childbearing age.
- **Family Planning**:
  - Prevent unintended pregnancies in HIV-positive women.
- **HIV Testing and Counseling**:
  - Routine HIV testing during antenatal visits.
- **Linkage to Care**:
  - Ensure HIV-positive pregnant women are linked to care and treatment services.
