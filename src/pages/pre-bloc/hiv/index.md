# HIV and AIDS

## Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

> HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system, specifically the CD4+ T cells.

### Transmission

- Sexual contact
- Blood transfusion
- Sharing needles
- Mother-to-child during birth or breastfeeding

### Types

1. HIV-1 (most common and virulent)
2. HIV-2 (less common, primarily in West Africa)

### Pathophysiology

- Virus integrates its RNA into the host's DNA.
- Replicates and destroys CD4+ T cells.
- Leads to weakened immune response.

## Acute HIV Infection

### Symptoms (2-4 weeks post-exposure):

- Fever
- Rash
- Lymphadenopathy
- Sore throat
- Fatigue
- Myalgia
- Mouth ulcers

### Duration

Lasts for a few weeks before progressing to chronic HIV infection.

## Chronic HIV Infection

### Stages

1. Clinical Latency:
   - Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; virus continues to multiply.
2. Symptomatic HIV Infection:
   - Immune system weakens; increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.

### Duration

Can last for several years without treatment.

## Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

> Advanced stage of HIV infection characterized by a severely weakened immune system.

### Diagnosis Criteria

- CD4+ T cell count <200 cells/mmÂ³
- Presence of AIDS-defining conditions (e.g., certain cancers, opportunistic infections)

### Common AIDS-Defining Conditions

- Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)
- Kaposi's sarcoma
- Cryptococcal meningitis
- Cytomegalovirus retinitis
- Tuberculosis (TB)
- Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection

## Diagnosis

### Screening Tests

- Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
- Rapid HIV tests

### Confirmatory Tests

- Western blot
- HIV RNA PCR
- HIV-1/2 differentiation assay

### Monitoring

- CD4+ T cell count
- HIV viral load

## Prevention

### Primary Prevention

- Safe sex practices (condom use)
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
- Safe needle practices
- Blood screening

### Mother-to-Child Prevention

- Antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Cesarean delivery if viral load is high
