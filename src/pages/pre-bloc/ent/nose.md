# Anatomy of Nose

- **Function**: Respiration, Olfaction (Smelling), Phonation

## External Nose

1. **Nasal Bones**: The bridge of the nose
1. **Cartilages**
   - Lateral cartilages
   - Alar cartilages
   - Septal cartilage
1. **Nasal Septum**
   - Divide the nasal cavity into two nostrils
   - Made up of the vomer, perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and septal cartilage
1. **Nares (Nostrils)**: External openings

## Internal Nose

### Nasal Cavity

1. **Divisions**
   - **Vestibule**: Lined with skin and hair follicles
   - **Respiratory Region**: Lined with respiratory epithelium (cilated pseudostratified columnar epithelium)
   - **Olfactory Region**: Lined with olfactory epithelium
1. **Nasal Conchae (Turbinates)**
   - Superior, Middle, and Inferior Conchae
1. **Nasal Meatuses**
   - Passages located beneath each concha through which air flows

### Paranasal Sinuses

Function of paranasal sinuses is reduction of skull weight.

1. **Maxillary Sinuses**: Located in the maxilla (cheekbones)
1. **Frontal Sinuses**: Located in the frontal bone (forehead)
1. **Ethmoid Sinuses**: Located between the nose and eyes
1. **Sphenoid Sinuses**: Located behind the ethmoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone

## Nerve Supply

### Sensory Innervation

1. **Olfactory Nerve (Cranial Nerve I)**: Sense of smell
1. **Trigeminal Nerve (Cranial Nerve V)**
   - **Ophthalmic Branch (V1)**: Upper part of the nasal cavity
   - **Maxillary Branch (V2)**: Lower part of the nasal cavity, palate, teeth

### Autonomic Innervation

1. **Parasympathetic**: Via the `facial nerve (Cranial Nerve VII)`, Control mucous secretion
1. **Sympathetic**: From the `superior cervical ganglion`, Control vasoconstriction

## Blood Supply

### Arterial Supply

#### External Carotid Artery Branches

1. **Facial Artery**: Supply the external nose
1. **Maxillary Artery**: Supply the lateral wall and septum (via the sphenopalatine artery)

#### Internal Carotid Artery Branches

1. **Ophthalmic Artery**: Supply the upper part of the nasal cavity (via the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries)

#### Kiesselbach's Plexus (Little's Area)

- A region in the anterior part of the nasal septum where several arteries anastomose
- **Common site of epistaxis (nosebleed)**

### Venouse Drainage

1. Anterior Part → **Facial vein**
1. Posterior Part → **Sphenopalatine vein** → Pterygoid Plexus and Cavernous sinus
