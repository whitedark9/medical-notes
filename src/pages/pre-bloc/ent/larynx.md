# Anatomy of Larynx

> Larynx (Voice box) is a cartilaginous structure located in the anterior part of the neck, superior to the trachea and inferior to the pharynx

- **Function**: Breathing (Respiration), Phonation (Speech), Protecting the treache against food aspiration

## Structure

The larynx is composed of several cartilages, membranes, muscles and ligaments.

### Cartilages

1. Thyroid Cartilage (Adam's apple)
1. Cricoid Cartilage (Under thyroid cartilage)
1. Epiglottis
   - Leaf-shaped cartilage
   - Located behind the tongue and hyoid bone, above the laryngeal inlet
   - Cover the glottis during swallowing (to prevent food from entering the trachea)
1. Arytenoid Cartilages (Pairs)
1. Corniculate Cartilages (Pairs)
1. Cuneiform Cartilages (Pairs)

### Membranes and Ligaments

1. Thyrohyoid Membranes: Connect the thyroid cartilage to the hyroid bone
1. Cricothyroid Ligament: Connect the throid cricoid carilage to the thyroid cartilage
1. Vocal Ligaments (True Vocal Cords): Responsible for sound production
1. Vestibular Ligament (False Vocal Cords): Do not play a direct role in sound production

### Muscles

#### Intrinsic Muscles

> Control the tension and position of the vocal cords

1. Cricothyroid Muscle
1. Thyroarytenoid Muscle
1. Posterior Cricoarytenoid Muscle
1. Lateral Cricoarytenoid Muscle
1. Transverse and Oblique Arytenoid Muscles

#### Extrinsic Muscles

> Support and position the larynx in the neck

1. Sternothyroid
1. Thyrohyroid
1. Omohyoid

## Nerve Supply

1. Superior Laryngeal Nerve
   - Branch of `Vagus Nerve (X)`
   - Divide into `internal branch` (`sensory` to the mucosa above the vocal cords) and `external branch` (`motor` to the cricothyroid muscle)
1. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve
   - Branch of `Vagus Nerve (X)`
   - Provide `motor` innervation to all intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid) and `sensory` innervation below the vocal cords

## Blood Supply

### Arteries

1. Superior Laryngeal Artery: Branch of the superior thyroid artery
1. Inferior Laryngeal Artery: Branch of the inferior thyroid artery

### Veins

1. Superior Laryngeal Vein: Drains into the superior thyroid vein
1. Inferior Laryngeal Vein: Drains into the inferior thyroid vein
