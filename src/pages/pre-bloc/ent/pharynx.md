# Anatomy of Pharynx

> A muscular tube that serves as a passage for both air and food. It connects the nasal and oral cavities to the larynx and oesophagus.

- Can be divided into three parts: `Nasopharynx`, `Oropharynx`, `Laryngopharynx (Hypopharynx)`

## Regions of the Pharynx

### Nasopharynx

- Upper part of the pharynx
- Behind the nasal cavity
- Above the soft palate

#### Function [#naso]

- Air passage
- Contain the pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids)

#### Features [#naso]

- Contain [Eustachian tube](/ent#eustachian-tube) openings that connect the middle ear

---

### Oropharynx

- Middle part of the pharynx
- Behind the oral cavity

#### Function [#oro]

- Passage for both air and food
- Swallowing and Speech

#### Features [#oro]

- Contain the palatine tonsils and lingual tonsils

---

### Laryngopharynx (Hypopharynx)

- Lower part of the pharynx
- Extend from the upper border of the epiglottis to the esophagus

#### Function [#lar]

- Passage for both air and food
- Direct food into the esophagus and air into the larynx

#### Features [#lar]

- Contain the opening to the esophagus and larynx

## Other Structures

### Larynx (Voice Box)

- Below the pharynx, continuous with the trachea
- Produce sound
- Protect the trachea against food aspiration

### Epiglottis

- A flap of cartilage that covers the trachea
- Prevent food from entering the airway during swallowing

### Tonsils

1. Palatine Tonsils: Located on either side of the oropharynx
1. Pharyngeal Tonsils (Adenoids): Located in the roof of the nasopharynx
1. Lingual Tonsils: Located at the base of the tongue in the oropharynx

### Eustachian Tube

- Connect the middle ear to the nasopharynx to equalize air pressure

### Esophagus

- A muscular tube that carries food and liquid from the pharynx to the stomach

## Common Disorders of Throat

### Pharyngitis

> Inflammation of pharynx (sore throat)

![Pharyngitis](/ent/pharyngitis.png)

#### Causes [#pharyngitis]

- Viral infections (e.g. common cold, influenza)
- Bacterial infections (e.g. _Streptococcus pyogenes_)
- Allergies and irritants (e.g. smoke, pollution)

#### Symptoms [#pharyngitis]

- Sore throat
- Pain while swallowing
- Red and swollen pharynx
- Fever and general malaise
- Swallon lymph nodes

---

### Pharyngeal Cancer

> Malignant tumors in the pharynx, including nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancers

#### Causes [#cancer]

- Tobacco and alcohol use
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
- Genetics

#### Symptoms [#cancer]

- Persistant sore throat
- Difficulty swallowing
- Ear pain and hearing loss (if involved `nasopharynx`)
- Hoarseness and voice changes
- Unexplained weight loss and fatigue
- Lumps in the neck due to lymph node involvement

#### Management [#cancer]

- Surgery, Radiation, Chemotherapy

---

### Tonsillitis

> Inflammation of the tonsils, especially the palatine tonsils

![Tonsillitis](/ent/tonsillitis.jpg)

#### Causes [#tonsilitis]

- Infections: Viral and bacterial
- Commonest: _Streptococcus pyogenes_

#### Symptoms [#tonsilitis]

- Severe sore throat
- Difficulty swallowing
- Red and swollen tonsils (often with white patches or pus)
- Fever and headache
- Swollen cervical lymph nodes

#### Management [#tonsilitis]

- Symptomatic treatment
- Antibiotics
- Tonsillectomy in recurrent or chronic cases

---

### Peritonsillar Abscess

> A complication of tonsillitis where pus collects in the tissues around the tonsils

#### Causes [#peri]

- Usually followed by untreated or severe tonsillitis

#### Symptoms [#peri]

- More severe symptoms
- Difficulty opening the mouth

#### Management [#peri]

- Drainage of the abscess
- Pain management
- Tonsillectomy to prevent recurrence

---

### Epiglottitis

> Inflammation of the epiglottis, which can block the airway and be ~~life-threatening~~

#### Causes [#epi]

- Bacterial infection (_Haemophilus influenzae type b_)
- Viral and fungal infections in immunocompromised people

#### Symptoms [#epi]

- Severe sore throat
- Difficulty swallowing
- Stridor (high-pitched breathing sound) and respiratory distress
- Hoarseness and muffled voice

#### Management [#epi]

- Emergency airway management (intubation or tracheostomy)
- IV antibiotics and corticosteroids
- Hospitalization

---

### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

> Regurgitation of acid into the esophagus and pharynx

#### Causes [#gerd]

- Weak lower esophageal sphincter
- Obesity, pregnancy and certain food and medications

#### Symptoms [#gerd]

- Sore throat
- Hoarseness
- Acid taste in mouth
- Heart burn
- Chest pain

#### Managment [#gerd]

- Lifestyle changes
- Antacids, H2 blockers, PPI (Proton pump inhibitors)
- Surgical intervention in severe cases
