# Anatomy of Chest for X-Ray

## Bony Structures

### Ribs

- 12 pairs: 1-7 true ribs, 8-10 false ribs, 11-12 floating ribs
- Visible as curving shadows extending from the spine to the sternum

### Clavicles

- Paired bones extending horizontally from the sternum to the shoulders

### Sternum

- Manubrium, body, and xiphoid process visible in the midline

### Vertebrae

- Thoracic vertebrae visible along the spine

## Soft Tissues

### Lungs

- Right lung (three lobes: upper, middle, lower) and left lung (two lobes: upper, lower)
- Pulmonary vasculature visible

### Mediastinum

- Contains the heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, thymus, and lymph nodes

## Heart and Great Vessels

### Heart

- Positioned centrally with the apex pointing leftward
- Right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle identifiable

### Aorta

- Ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta visible

### Pulmonary Arteries and Veins

- Arteries branching from the right ventricle, veins returning oxygenated blood to the left atrium

### Diaphragm

- Right dome higher than the left due to the liver
- Separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity

## Blood Supply

### Lungs [#BS]

- Pulmonary arteries (deoxygenated blood)
- Pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood)

### Heart [#BS]

- Coronary arteries and veins

## Nerve Supply

### Lungs [#NS]

- Pulmonary plexus (sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation)

### Diaphragm [#NS]

- Phrenic nerve (C3-C5)

## Applied Anatomy

### Chest X-Ray Interpretation

- Used to evaluate **lung fields**, **heart size**, **mediastinal contours**, **diaphragmatic position**
- Common pathologies: `pneumonia`, `pneumothorax`, `pleural effusion`, `heart failure`

### Landmarks for Procedures

- Central venous catheter placement: internal jugular or subclavian vein landmarks
- Chest tube insertion: typically in the 4th or 5th intercostal space, midaxillary line
- Common Conditions Identified
  - `Pneumonia`: localized opacities
  - `Pneumothorax`: loss of lung markings
  - `Pleural Effusion`: blunted costophrenic angles
  - `Cardiomegaly`: enlarged cardiac silhouette
