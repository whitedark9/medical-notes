## Assess the Severity of Pneumonia

### In Children (2 months - 5 years) with Cough or Difficult Breathing

#### 1. Very Severe Pneumonia

  - Drowsiness or lethargy or unconsciousness.
  - Convulsions.
  - Inability to drink or breastfeed.
  - Persistent vomiting.
- **Or** central cyanosis (bluish discoloration of lips or face).
- Severe respiratory distress (e.g., grunting, head nodding).

#### 2. Severe Pneumonia

- Cough or difficult breathing **plus** one of the following:
  - Lower chest wall indrawing (subcostal or intercostal).
  - Nasal flaring.
  - Oxygen saturation (SpO₂) < 90%.

#### 3. Pneumonia

- Cough or difficult breathing **plus** one of the following:
  - Fast breathing:
    - Age < 2 months: >= 60/min
    - Age 2-10 months: >= 50/min
    - Age 1-5 years: >= 40/min
  - Chest ausculation signs of pneumonia:
    - Decreased breath sounds
    - Bronchial breath sounds
    - Crackles
    - Abnormal vocal resonance
    - Pleural rub

#### 4. No Pneumonia (Cough or Cold)

## Management

### 1. Very Severe Pneumonia (or Disease)

1. **Hospital Admission**: Immediate.
2. **Oxygen Therapy**: To maintain SpO₂ ≥ 92%.
3. **Antibiotics:**
   - First-line: `IV Ampicillin + Gentamicin`
   - Alternative: `Ceftriaxone` or `other broad-spectrum antibiotics` if no response to first-line or based on local resistance patterns.
4. **Supportive Care:**
   - Ensure `IV fluids` or nasogastric feeding if unable to feed.
   - `Antipyretics` for fever.
   - Monitor for complications like sepsis or pleural effusion.
5. **Treat Complications**:
   - Manage shock, convulsions, or severe dehydration if present.

### 2. Severe Pneumonia

1. **Hospital Admission**: Required.
2. **Oxygen Therapy**: If SpO₂ < 90% or signs of respiratory distress.
3. **Antibiotics:**
   - First-line: `IV Ampicillin` or `IV Penicillin`
   - Add `Gentamicin` if no improvement.
   - Alternative: `Ceftriaxone` if higher resistance or no response.
4. **Supportive Care:**
   - Continue breastfeeding or feeding if possible.
   - `IV fluids` if oral intake is inadequate.
   - `Antipyretics` for fever control.

### 3. Pneumonia

1. **Outpatient Treatment**: Home management unless complications arise.
2. **Antibiotics:**
   - First-line: `Oral Amoxicillin for 5 days`
   - Alternative: `Co-trimoxazole` or `Azithromycin` if allergic to `penicillin`.
3. **Follow-up**:
   - Reassess in **2 days** to check for improvement.
   - Advise caregivers on signs of deterioration (difficulty breathing, inability to feed).
4. **Supportive Care:**
   - Continue feeding and hydration.
   - `Antipyretics` (e.g., `Paracetamol`) for fever.

### 4. No Pneumonia (Cough or Cold)

1. **No Antibiotics**: Not required.
2. **Supportive Care**:
   - **Home care** with advice on fluids and feeding.
   - Use of **saline nasal drops** for nasal congestion.
   - Ensure **adequate hydration** and nutrition.
   - `Paracetamol` if fever is present.
3. **Follow-up**:
   - Advise caregiver to return if symptoms worsen (fast breathing, difficulty feeding).
