# Asthma

> 4 years old boy came to outpatient clinic presenting with nocturnal cough and recurrent wheezing. How would you approach this child to get the diagnosis? Discuss management of acute severe bronchial asthma. (UM1)

## Diagnosis

### History

1. **Cough characteristics**:
   - Timing: Nocturnal cough (suggestive of asthma).
   - Trigger factors: Cold air, exercise, smoke, allergens.
   - Response to bronchodilators.
2. **Wheezing**:
   - Frequency, severity, and duration of episodes.
   - Wheezing during viral infections.
3. **Family history**:
   - Asthma, allergies, eczema.
4. **Allergic symptoms**:
   - Rhinorrhea, sneezing, atopic dermatitis.
5. **Environmental factors**:
   - Exposure to allergens (dust, pets, pollen).
   - Second-hand smoke exposure.
6. **Growth and development**:
   - Any failure to thrive or developmental delay.
7. **Medication history**:
   - Previous use of bronchodilators or corticosteroids.
   - Recent medication use (e.g., `antibiotics`, `OTC meds`).

### Physical Examination

1. **Inspection**:
   - Use of accessory muscles of respiration.
   - Tachypnea, nasal flaring.
   - Cyanosis in severe cases.
2. **Auscultation**:
   - Widespread wheezing, decreased breath sounds in severe obstruction.
3. **Vitals**:
   - Assess respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Investigations

1. **Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)**:
   - To assess airway obstruction.
2. **Chest X-ray**:
   - Rule out other causes of wheezing (e.g., foreign body, pneumonia).
   - Hyperinflation in asthma.
3. **Spirometry (if feasible)**:
   - Demonstrates reversible airway obstruction.
4. **Allergy Testing**:
   - To identify potential allergens (optional).

## Management of Acute Severe Bronchial Asthma

### Investigations

- **Pulse oximetry**:
  - To monitor oxygen saturation.
- **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**:
  - In very severe cases to assess respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia.
- **Chest X-ray** (if needed):
  - To exclude complications like pneumothorax or pneumonia.

### Treatment

### Initial management (in clinic or emergency department):

1. **High Flow Oxygen**:
   - Maintain O₂ saturation > 94%.
2. **Short-acting β2-agonists (SABA)**:
   - `salbutamol 2.5 mg/dose for < 5 years & 5 mg/dose for > 5 years` via nebulizer or `salbutamol inhalation` via spacer every 30 minutes for 2 hours, (if not improve: refer to ICU)
3. **Ipratropium bromide**:
   - Add to `salbutamol` for severe cases (combination nebulizer).
4. **Corticosteroids**:
   - Oral or IV `prednisolone` or `hydrocortisone`.
   - Start early for all moderate to severe exacerbations.
5. `Magnesium sulfate (IV)`:
   - In life-threatening asthma or if poor response to initial treatment.

### Monitoring:

- **Continuous monitoring** of O₂ saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate.

### Escalation if poor response:

- `IV Aminophylline`:
  - Consider if not improving with nebulized treatments.
- **Intubation and mechanical ventilation**:
  - In cases of respiratory failure (impending respiratory arrest).

### Discharge plan:

- Continue SABA (`salbutamol`) as needed.
- Start or optimize inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for long-term control.
- Educate parents on:
  - _Correct inhaler technique_.
  - _Asthma action plan_.
  - Avoidance of triggers.

### Follow-up:

- Review after 24-48 hours.
- Long-term control with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
