# Aortic Insufficiency (Regurgitation)

- Combined mitral and aortic insufficiency is more common than aortic involvement alone

## Clinical Features

### Mild

- Asymptomatic

### Severe

- Exercise intolerance and dyspnoea
- Orthopnoea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND)
- Cardiomegaly
- Palpitations
- Collapsing water-hammer pulse
- Bounding carotic pulsations (Corrigan sign) or peripheral pulses
- Wide pulse pressure (elevated systolic blood pressure and lowered diastolic pressure)
- Left ventricular apical heave (LVH) with diastolic thrill
- EDM best over upper left sternal border with radiation to the apex and to aortic area. Easily audible with the diaphragm, in full expiration and the patient leaning forward

## Investigations

### CXR

- Left ventricle & aortic knuckle enlargement

### ECG

- LVH signs

### Echocardiogram

- Shows a large LV. Doppler studies demonstrate degree of aortic insuffciency

## Treatment

### Medical

1. Early detection, prompt and adequate treatment of infection
1. Medical treatment of heart failure if present
1. Treatment of carditis if present
1. Prevention of rheumatic fever (secondary prevention)
1. Prevention of infective endocarditis (tertiary prevention)

### Surgery

- Valve replacement

#### Indications

Signs of decreasing myocardial function manifested by

- Increasing left ventricular dimensions (echo)
- Decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction
