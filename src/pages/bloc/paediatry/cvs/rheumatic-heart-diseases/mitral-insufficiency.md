# Mitral Insufficiency (Regurgitation)

## Clinical Features

Clinical features depends on severity

### Mild

- No symptoms
- High pitch PSM (apex) radiates to axilla
- Signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure may be present

### Severe

- Exercise intolerance and dyspnoea
- Orthopnoea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND)
- Haemoptysis
- Hepatomegaly, Ascites, Oedema (due to pulmonary hypertension and RVH)
- Cardiomegaly
- Heaving apical left ventricular impulse (LVH)
- Apical systolic thrill
- Apical PSM radiating to axilla

## Investigation

### Severe MS

#### CXR

- Cardiomegaly (LA & LV prominence)
- Perihilar congestion (pulmonary venous hypertension)

#### ECG

- LAH & RAH (bifid P waves)
- LVH, VAD

#### Echocardiogram

- LA and LV
- Doppler: Demonstrate MR severity

## Treatment

### Medical

1. Early detection, prompt and adequate treatment of infection
1. Medical treatment of heart failure if present
1. Treatment of carditis if present
1. Prevention of rheumatic fever (secondary prevention)
1. Prevention of infective endocarditis (tertiary prevention)

### Surgical

- Valve repair (annuloplasty)
- Valve repalcement

#### Indications

- Recurrent heart failure, despite adequite medical treatment
- Dyspnoea with moderate activity
- Progressive cardiomegaly with pulmonary hypertension
