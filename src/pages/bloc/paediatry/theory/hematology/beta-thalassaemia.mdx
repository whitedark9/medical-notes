# Beta-Thalassaemia

> Describe the clinical features, investigation and management of beta thalassaemia major. (UMMG 2 times )

> Discuss the diagnosis, management and complications of ẞ thalassaemia major. (UMM)

## Definition

> Autosomal recessive genetic defects in globin chain synthesis causing disorder of hemoglobin production and abnormal erythropoiesis.

## Clinical Features

- Failure to thrive
  The infants are born normally, but later develop
- Anaemia & Jaundice
- Hepato-splenomegaly
- Thalassaemic facies characterized by:
  - Skull bossing
  - Prominent temporal and frontal eminence with flattened vault
  - Prominent malar eminence
  - Hypertrophy of mandible
  - Depressed nasal bridge
  - Straight forehead
- Teeth are malformed
- Less active
- Growth retardation
- Irregular fever and intercurrent infections
- Pathological fractures of long bones in untreated cases
- ~~Death~~ due to severe anemia, heart failure or liver failure

## Investigation

1. **Haemoglobin**: `Decreased` (2-6 g/dl)
1. **Haemoglobin electrophoresis**
   - To detect different types of haemoglobin such as Hb A, Hb A2, Hb F
1. Cells
   - **Erythrocyte (Mature RBCs) counts**: `Decreased`
   - **Reticulocyte (Immature RBCs) count**: `Increased`
   - **MCV & MCH**: `Decreased`
   - **Haematocrit**: `Decreased`
   - Mild leucocytosis and thrombocytosis due to prolonged stimulation of the bone marrow
1. **Peripheral smear**
   - Hypochromic microcytic anaemia
   - Target cells
   - Nucleated red cells
1. **Singers test**
1. **Serum bilirubin level**: `Increased` (unconjugated)
1. **Serum iron level**: `Increased` due to ineffective utlization
1. **Iron binding capacity**: `Decreased`
1. **Bone marrow**: `Hyperplasia`

### Antenatal Diagnosis

- Fetal blood sampling for globin chain synthesis
- Amniotic fluid cell culture
- Chorionic villus sampling

### Radiological changes

- Small bones of the hands:
  - Lace like pattern (Thinned cortex with widened medulla, increased trabeculations)
- Skull bones:
  - Hair on end appearance (Widening diploic space, separation of tables, thickening of vault)

## Management

### Blood transfusion

- The main managment is repeated blood transfusion.
- **Low transfusion regime**: Hb level 6-8 g/dl
- **High transfusion regime**: Hb level 8-10 g/dl
- **Super transfusion regime**: Hb level 10-12 g/dl
- **All thalassaemia patients should be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine before starting transfusion.**

### Chelation therapy

> 1 unit of blood = 200 mg of elemental iron

- Treatment should start at **serum iron ~2000 μg/l**
- `Desferrioxamine continuous subcutaneous infusion 25-50 mg/kg/day` over a period of 8-12 hours, during the night using micro infusion pump (at least 5-6 nights/week)
- `Deferiprone Oral`

### Splenectomy

#### Indications

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="">
  
  - Hypersplenism 
  - When the transfusion requirement exceeds 250 ml/kg/year of
  packed red cells 
  - Abdominal discomfort

</Callout>

- Children should be > 6 years to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis
- Children should be immunized with _meningococcal_, _pneumococcal_ and _H.influenzae_ vaccines.
- Life long `penicillin` prophylaxis after splenectomy
- Treatment of thrombosis after splenectomy with `aspirin`

### Diet

- Avoid iron, iron supplement to prevent iron overload
- Folic acid supplement: 1-5 mg/d

### New Therapeutic Approaches

1. Bone Marrow Transplantation
   - Defective stem cells are replaced with normal stem cells
   - This offers a cure but needs HLA matched sibling donor
1. Gene Manipulation
1. Gene Therapy

## Complication

- Due to **intramedullary erythropoiesis**
  - e.g., frontal bossing, prominent malar bones, etc.
- Due to **haemosiderosis**
  - Iron deposits in major organs: heart, liver, pancreas, etc.
- Due to **repeated blood transfusion** and **splenectomy**
  - Risk of transmission of infections (e.g, HIV, Hepatitis B & C, CMV)
  - Post splenectomy sepsis below 6 years of age
- **Aneamic heart failure**
- **Growth retardation**
- **Fracture of long bones**
