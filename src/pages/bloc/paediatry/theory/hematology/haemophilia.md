# Haemophilia

> Discuss the clinical features of haemophilia and management of haemophilia. (UMTG)

## Definition

> Hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive hereditary bleeding disorder characterized by the deficiency of specific clotting factors, leading to impaired blood clotting and prolonged bleeding.

### Types

1. Haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency)
2. Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency)

## Clinical Features

### Mild to Moderate Haemophilia

- Asymptomatic
- Prolonged bleeding following tooth extraction, severe trauma or following surgery

### Severe Haemophilia

- Prolonged bleeding
- Muscle haematoma (Bleeding into muslces)
- Haemarthrosis (Bleeding into joints)
  - Common in weight-bearing joints (knees, ankles, elbows)
- Severe mucosal bleeding
- Spontaneous bleeding episodes
- Excessive bleeding from umbilical cord in the newborn period
- Haematuria
- GI bleeding
- Intracranial bleeding (Fatal)

## Investigation

- **Bleeding time**: Normal
- **Clotting time**: Prolong
- **Prothrombin Time (PT)**: Normal
- **Activated partial thromboplastin time (ATPP)**: Prolong
- Factor VIII/IX assay
- **Platelet count**: Normal or Elevated

## Treatment

### Replacement Therapy

- Fresh blood (<8 hours old)
- Fresh plasma
- Fresh frozen plasma [^1]
- Cryoprecipitate [^2]
- Factor VIII concentrate

[^1]: **Fresh Frozen Plasma**: Plasma separated from whole blood and frozen to preserve clotting factors.
[^2]: **Cryoprecipitate**: A fraction of plasma that contains concentrated clotting factors, including fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and factor XIII.

### Drug Therapy

- DDAVP
  - For mild case
  - Increase factor VIII from endothelial cells
- Anti-fibrinolytics
  - Tranexamic acid
  - Promote haemostatis in oral bleeds
  - ~~Contraindicate in haematuria~~

### Treatment of Haemarthrosis

- Rest
- Ice compression
- Compression
- Elevation of dependent joint to a comfortable position
- ~~Never aspirate the haemarthrosis~~
- Analgesis
- Physiotherapy as soon as pain is relieved
