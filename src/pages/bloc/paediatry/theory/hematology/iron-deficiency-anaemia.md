# Iron Deficiency Anaemia

> Anaemia due to lack of iron for the syntehsis of hemoglobin.

## Causes

1. Low iron stores
   - Preterm and small for gestational age
   - Twins
2. Low iron intake
   - Breast milk has more iron source than cow milk.
3. Increase iron loss from the body through bleeding
   - Hookworm infestation
   - Hiatus hernia
4. Increase demand
   - Preterm and Low birth weight infants have to grow rapidly and have more demand.
5. Impaired iron absorption
   - Coeliac disease
6. Impaired iron metabolism
   - Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis
   - Sideroblastic anaemia

## Clinical Features

### 1. Signs and Symptoms of Anaemia

- Major symptom: **Pallor**
- **Onset**: insidious
- **Mood**: Pica (Unusual craving to eat)
- **Body**: Failure to thrive (growth retardation), Easily fatigue
- **Hands**: Thin, brittle and flat nails, Koilonychia
- **Spleen**: Splenomegaly (15% cases)
- **Immune**: Frequent infection
- **Heart**: Cardiomegaly, Murmurs (in severe anaemia)

### 2. Signs and Symptoms of Underlying Causes

- e.g., Clinical features of chronic infection: TB, Malaria, etc.

### 3. Signs and Symptoms of Complications

- Anaemic heart failure
- Splenomegaly
- Repeated upper respiratory tract infection

## Investigation

For the diagnosis of IDA and to find out the underlying causes.

- Blood for complete picture
  - **Bllod film**: Hypochromic microcytic anaemia
  - **Total and differential count**: Normal
  - **MCV, MCH and MCHC**: Reduced
- **Serum iron level**: < 30 ug/dl
- **Total iron binding capacity**: Increased
- **Reticulocyte count**: Decreased
- **Bone marrow**: Hypercellular with erythroid hyperplasia
- **Stool RE**: Hook worms and _Trichuriasis_
- **Stool for occult blood**: Present in hiatus hernia
- Blood for MP
- Urine RE
- Radiological investigation: CXR for TB

## Management

### Treat the underlying cause

- Deworm the patient
- Treat other causes of persistent blood loss if exists

### Iron Therapy

#### Oral Iron Therapy

- `Ferrous sulphate/Ferrous gluconate/Ferrous succinate`
- `Elemental iron 3-6 mg/kg orally` in 3 divied doses
- Do not give iron after feeding milk or food
- Continue for at least 6-8 weeks after Hb reaches normal level

#### Parental Iron Therapy

> Iron (mg) = weight (kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4

- `Iron dextran`
- Check peripheral reticulocytes within 3-4 days after administration of iron

## Prevention

- Avoid diet restriction
- Preterm and low birth weight needs more iron
- Give supplementary foods rich in iron from 4 months of age
- Iron supplements during adolescence
- Vitamin C in diet to increase iron absorption
- Deworming and wear shoes
