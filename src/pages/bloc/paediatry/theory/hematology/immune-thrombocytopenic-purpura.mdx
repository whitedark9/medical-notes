## Differentiating Points Between ITP and Aplastic Anaemia

1. **Definition**:

   - **ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura)**: An autoimmune disorder characterized by `isolated thrombocytopenia` (low platelet count) due to platelet destruction by autoantibodies.
   - **Aplastic Anemia**: A bone marrow failure syndrome resulting in `pancytopenia` (reduction in all blood cell lines: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to decreased production of all blood cells.

2. **Etiology**:

   - **ITP**:
     - Autoimmune mechanism where antibodies target platelets.
     - Can be idiopathic or secondary to infections (e.g., viral), medications, or autoimmune diseases.
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - Damage to the bone marrow stem cells (due to radiation, chemicals, medications, viruses, or autoimmune mechanisms).
     - Can be idiopathic or secondary to known causes.

3. **Blood Count**:

   - **ITP**:
     - Isolated thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
     - Normal white blood cells (WBCs)
     - Normal red blood cells (RBCs)
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - Pancytopenia (low WBCs, RBCs, and platelets).

4. **Bone Marrow Findings**:

   - **ITP**:
     - Normal or increased megakaryocytes (indicating adequate platelet production).
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - Hypocellular bone marrow with fatty replacement (few hematopoietic cells present).

5. **Clinical Features**:

   - **ITP**:
     - **Symptoms of Thrombocytopenia**:
     - **Skin bleeding**: Easy bruising
     - **Subcutaneous bleeding**: Petechiae, Purpura, Ecchymosis
     - **Mucosal bleeding**: Haematesis, Melena, Haemorrhages in the brain
     - No anemia or infections unless due to other causes.
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - Fatigue, pallor (from anemia)
     - Recurrent infections (from neutropenia)
     - Bleeding (from thrombocytopenia)

6. **Response to Treatment**:

   - **ITP**:
     - Responds to immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., `corticosteroids`, `IVIG`, `splenectomy`).
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - May require bone marrow transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy, or hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., `G-CSF`).

7. **Prognosis**:
   - **ITP**:
     - Generally good with treatment; relapses may occur.
   - **Aplastic Anemia**:
     - More serious; outcomes depend on severity and treatment response, particularly bone marrow transplantation.

## Management of ITP

### Investigation

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
  - Isolated thrombocytopenia < 100,000/mm3
  - Normal white blood cells
  - Normal red blood cells
- **Bleeding time**: Prolong
- **Platelet antibodies**: Present in 70-90% of children
- **Bone marrow**: Normal or increased megakaryocytes

### Treatment

#### Treatment of Acute ITP

##### Platelet Count > 40,000/mm3

- No specific treatment
- Avoid aspirin and related drugs
- Avoid intramuscular injections during the acute phase
- Admit to hospital if platelet count < 20,000/mm3

##### Platelet Count < 25,000/mm3

1. **Corticosteroids**
   - Inhibit platelet antibody production, interaction between platelet and antibodies, prolong platelet survival and improve vascular stability
   - `Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks`, followed by tapering the doses over the next 1-2 weeks, regardless the response
2. **Intravenous immunoglobin** (IV-IgG)
   - Increase platelet count by blocking Fc receptor and protects the platelets from antibodies
   - `IV-IgG 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days` or
   - `IV-IgG 1 g/kg for 2 consecutive days`
3. **Intravenous anti-D therapy**
   - For life-threatening haemorrhage
4. **Splenectomy**

###### Indications

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="">
  
  - Hypersplenism 
  - When the transfusion requirement exceeds 250 ml/kg/year of
  packed red cells 
  - Abdominal discomfort

</Callout>

- Children should be > 6 years to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis
- Children should be immunized with _meningococcal_, _pneumococcal_ and _H.influenzae_ vaccines.
- Life long `penicillin` prophylaxis after splenectomy
- Treatment of thrombosis after splenectomy with `aspirin`

##### Intracranial Haemorrhage (ICH)

- Common in platelet count < 20,000/mm3
- Platelet count should be increased rapidly with `IV-IgG`, `methylprednisolone` or `platelet transfusion`
- `Splenectomy` if above measures fail

---

#### Treatment of Chronic ITP

> Goal of therapy is to decrease the risk of serious haemorrhage, rather than to achieve normal platelet count

- `Corticosteroid`
- Immunosuppressives: `Cyclophosphamid`, `Azathioprine`, `Cyclosporin`
- `Splenectomy`
