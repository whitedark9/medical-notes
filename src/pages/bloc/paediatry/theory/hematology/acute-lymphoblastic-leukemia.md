# Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia

> What are the 5 common differential diagnosis of anaemia with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy of children. Describe diagnosis and management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia? (UM2)

## Definition

> Leukaemias are a group of disorders characterized by the accumulation of malignant white cells in the bone marrow and blood, leading to bone marrow failure and infiltration of organs.

## Differential Diagnosis of Anaemia with Hepatosplenomegaly and Lymphadenopathy

1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
2. Lymphoma (Hodgkin's/Non-Hodgkin's)
3. Thalassemia (Major)
4. Infectious Mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr Virus)
5. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
6. Hepatitis B or C

## History

- **Anemia**
  - Dyspnoea in exersion
  - Fatigue
  - Weakness
  - Pallor
- **Neutropenia**
  - Recurent infection
  - Fever
- **Bleeding**
  - Brusing
  - Red spots under the skin
  - Nose bleeds, Gum bleeding
- **Bone pain, Joint Pain**
- Abnormal swellings (**Lymphadenopathy**)
- Abdominal Pain, Discomfort (**Hepatosplenomegaly**)

## Physical Examination

- Pallor (Anaemia)
- Petechiae, Purpura, Ecchymoses (Thrombocytopenia)
- Fever
- Lymphadenopathy (Cervical, Axillary, Inuinal regions)
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Bone tenderness (Long bones)
- Sternum tenderness

## Investigations

- **Blood for Complete Picture**
  - Hemoglobin: Low (Anaemia)
  - Platelet: Low (Thrombocytopenia)
  - Neutrophil: Low (Neutropenia)
  - Atypical cells or blast cells
- **Periphehral Blood Smear**
  - Immature WBC (blasts)
  - Abnormal WBC
- **Bone Marrow Aspiration**
  - For diagnosis
  - Increase cell numbers
  - > 20 % Blasts: Confirm ALL diagnosis
- **Cytogenetic Analysis**
- **Immunophenotyping** (Flow cytometry)
- **Biochemistry**
  - Urea and electrolytes
  - Uric acid
  - Renal and liver function tests
  - Calcium and Phosphate
- **Infection Screen**
  - ESR
  - CRP
  - Cultures & Sensitivity (Blood, urine, stool, CSF)
  - Swabs (ENT, any septic lesion)
- **Serological tests**
  - HIV
  - Hepatitis B & C
  - EBV
  - CMV
- **Imaging**
  - Chest X-Ray
  - Ultrasound abdomen
  - CT, MRI

## Treatment

### Main Treatment

- Chemotherapy
- Radiotherapy
- Surgery: Only for diagnosis and treatment of complication
- Bone marrow transplant and Immunotherapy

### Emergency Treatment

- Bleeding
- Febrile neutropenia
- Tumour lysis syndrome [^1]
- Mediastinal obstruction

### Supportive Treatment

- Replacement of blood and blood products
- Prevention and control of infection
- Nursing care
- Fluid and electrolytes
- Food and nutrition
- Symptom control: pain, vomiting, insomnia, anorexia, etc.
- Play and occupational therapy
- Vascular access
- Counselling and support
- Management of terminally ill child

### Specific Treatment

- **CNS directed therapy is included in each phase**

#### Induction of remission

- To induce remission by using a `combination of anticancer drugs +/- Radiotherapy`

#### Consolidation

- To eliminate or reduce hidden leukaemic cell population with `intensive chemotherapy`

#### Maintenance

- To reduce the risk of relapse

### Management of Complications

- **Complications of leukemia**: Sepsis, Bleeding, Others
- **Complications of therapy**: Adverse effects of steroids, specific anti-cancer drugs
