# Down's Syndrome

> Describe the characteristic features of Down's syndrome and briefly discuss the principles of genetic counseling. (UM2) (UM1) (UMMG)

> Describe the clinical features, associated problems and management of a child with Down syndrome. (UM1) (UMTG)

## Causes

- Most common autosomal trisomy
- Most common genetic cause of severe learning difficulties
- Karyotype of `Down Syndrome` is `trisomy 21`

## Types of Down Syndrome

1. **Non-disjunction** (95%)

   - Error at meiosis
   - Karyotype - `47 XX/XY (+21)`

1. **Translocation** (4%)

   - Commonest - 14/21
   - Karyotype - `46 XX/XY (-14,-21) (t14:21)`

1. **Mosaicism** (1%)

   - Some of the cells are normal and some have `trisomy 21`
   - Karotype - `47 XY +21/46 XY`

## Risk of Down Syndrome

- All ages (risk rises with increasing maternal age)

## Clincal Features of Down Syndrome

### Characteristic Physical Features

#### Head & Faces

![Down Syndrome Head](/paediatrics/down-syndrome-head.jpg)

![Down Syndrome Face](/paediatrics/down-syndrome-face.png)

- Small head with flat occiput (brachycephaly)
- Small nose with flat nasal bridge
- Small mouth
- Flat facies
- Protruded fissured tongue
- Upward slanting eyes/palpebral fissures (Mongoloid slant)
- Prominent inner epicanthic folds
- Brushfield spots in iris
- Low set ears

#### Limbs

![Down Syndrome Hand](/paediatrics/down-syndrome-hand.jpg)

- Short and broad hands
- Incurved little finger (clinodactyly)
- Wide space between the first and second toes
- Hyperflexibility of joints

### Intellectual Disabilities

### Hypotonia

### Dermatoglyphics (Fingerprints)

![Down Syndrome Fingerprint](/paediatrics/ulnar-loop.jpg)

- Single palmar crease (Simian crease)
- Excess ulnar loops on finger tips
- Distal location of palmar triradius (angle of triradii > 60%)

### Growth Retardation

### Associated Problems/Anomalites

- Alzheimer disease
- Hypothyroidism
- Atlanto-axial instability
- Congenital heart disease (40% of cases)
  - Most common - `Ventricular septal defect`, `Arterioventricular septal defect`, `Patent ductus arteriosus`
- Congenital GI anomalies
  - `Duodenal atriasia`
  - `Oesophageal atriasia`
  - `Inperforate anus`
  - `Hirschprung's disease`
- Recurrent respiratory tract infection including `pneumonia`
- Prone to infection
- Increase risk of `leukemias`

## Management of Down Syndrome

- _No specific treatment_, Only supportive measures
- Diagnosis should be confirmed by `chromosomal analysis` (Karyotyping)

### Supportive Measures

#### Community Support

- Early stimulation programme
- Speech therapy in older children
- Special education and occupational training
- Parental support/counseling
- Psychological support

#### Medical Support

- Regular check-up for associated problems

  - ENT, ophthalmic and cardiac evaluations
  - Thyroid function test

- Treatment of associated problems

  - Surgical interventions (e.g. congenital heart disease GI tract anomalies)
  - Medical interventions (e.g. recurrent infections, leukiemia)

#### Future Plans

- Genetic counseling
  - How and why the condition has risen
  - Risk of recurrence
    - translocation - 10%
    - non-disjunction - 1%
- Antenal diagnosis for future pregnancies
