# Principles of Prevention of Genetic Diseases

> Describe the characteristic features of Down's syndrome and briefly discuss the principles of genetic counseling. (UM2) (UM1) (UMMG)

> SN. Prenatal/Antenatal diagnosis for prevention of Genetic disease (UM2)

## Genetic Counseling

> A process of communication and information which deals with the problems associated with a genetic disease in the family.

### Aim

> To provide information to make a better choice in reproductive decisions

### Objectives

- Establishing the **correct diagnosis**
- **Risk** estimation
- Reducing **anxiety** and guilt
- Communication and **information**
- Discussing the **options** available
- **Prevention** of genetic disease

### Procedures

- **Communication and information** is the main part of counseling.
- Genetic counseling can be done by **any physician** who understands genetic mechanisms of diseases properly.
- If there is a risk to the offspring, the counselor discusses the **available options** such as
  - not having (more) children
  - ignoring the risk
  - artificial insemination
  - antenatal diagnosis
  - termination of pregnancy
- The counselor should be **non-directive** (he or she only assists in the decision-making process)

### Indications for Genetic Counseling

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>

- Known or suspected genetic disease in a patient or family
- Birth defects in previous children
- Consanguinity
- Identification of malformations by ultrasonography during pregnancy

</Callout>

## Prenatal/Antenal Diagnosis

### Screening Tests for Maternal Blood

1. Testing for `neutral tube defects`
1. Testing for `Down's syndrome` (Triple test)

### Ultrasound Screening

Following information can be obtained:

- Gestational age
- Multiple pregnancy
- Structural malformations (e.g., anencephaly)
- Foetal growth
- Amnotic fluid volume (Oligohydramios, Polyhydramios)

### Tissue Samplings (In utero)

1. **Chorionic villous sampling**
   - Done in first trimester
   - Test for `Chromosomal analysis`, `Enzyme analysis`, `DNA analysis`, `Congenital infection`
   - 2-4% risk of foetal loss
1. **Amniocentesis**
   - Done in second trimester
   - Test for `Chromosomal anlysis`, `Enzyme analysis`
   - 0.5-1% risk of foetal loss
1. **Fetal blood sampling**
   - Done after 18 weeks of gestation
   - Test for `Rapid chromosomal analysis`, `Severe rhesus isoimmunization assessment`, `Congenital infection serology`
1. **Fetal tissue sampling**
   - Skin biopsy, Embryo biopsy
