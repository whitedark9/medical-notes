## Management of Bronchilitis

### Investigation

- Identification of RSV (Respiratory Syncitial Virus)
  - Nasopharyngeal secretions by using fluorescent antibody test (Rapid test)
- CXR
  - Hyperinflation of the lung field due to air trapping
- Blood gas analysis
  - Lower arterial O2 and raised CO2 tension in more severe cases

### Treatment

- `Supportive`
  - **Oxygen** to maintain SpO2 > 92% by nasal catheter or head box
  - Adequate **hydration** by nasal or IV if needed
  - If possible, **monitored** by pulse oxymeter and adjust the Oxygen concentration
  - **Cardiopulmonary monitoring**: For apnoea, signs of respiratory failure, drowsiness, respiratory distress and cyanosis, signs of heart failure
- `Antibiotics`: If suspect sceondary bacterial infection
- `Steroid`, `bronchodilator`: Controversial
- `Antiviral drug (Ribavirin)`: May use in infants with underlying cardiopulmonary disorder or immunodeficiency
- `Mechinical ventilation`: Require in 2% of patients
