# Asthma

> 4 years old boy came to outpatient clinic presenting with nocturnal cough and recurrent wheezing. How would you approach this child to get the diagnosis? Discuss management of acute severe bronchial asthma. (UM1)

## Diagnosis

### History

#### Cough characteristics

- Timing: `Nocturnal cough` (suggestive of asthma).
- Trigger factors: Cold air, exercise, smoke, allergens.
- Response to bronchodilators.

#### Wheezing

- Frequency, severity, and duration of episodes.
- Wheezing during viral infections.

#### Allergic symptoms

- Rhinorrhea, sneezing, atopic dermatitis.

#### Family history

- Asthma, allergies, eczema.

#### Environmental factors

- Exposure to `allergens` (dust, pets, pollen).
- Second-hand smoke exposure.

#### Developmental History

- Any failure to thrive or developmental delay.

#### Medication history

- Previous use of `bronchodilators` or `corticosteroids`.
- Recent medication use (e.g., `antibiotics`, `OTC meds`).

### Physical Examination

#### General

- Dyspnoea
- Nasal flaring
- Cyanosis (in severe case)
- Wheezing

#### Extremities

- Peripheral cyanosis

#### Chest

1. Inspection
   - **Shape**: Pectus excavatum or Harrison's sulcus in uncontrolled asthama
   - Use of accessory muscles of respiration.
   - Tachypnea
1. Palpation
   - Chest wall movement is decreased on both sides
1. Percussion
   - Normal or hyper-resonant
1. Auscultation
   - Breath sound is reduced
   - Wide spread rhonchi

### Investigations

- **Pulse oximetry**:
  - To monitor oxygen saturation.
- **Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)**:
  - To assess airway obstruction.
- **Chest X-ray**:
  - Rule out other causes of wheezing (e.g., foreign body, pneumonia).
  - Hyperinflation in asthma.
- **Spirometry (if feasible)**:
  - Demonstrates reversible airway obstruction.
- **Allergy Testing**:
  - To identify potential allergens (optional).
- **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**:
  - In very severe cases to assess respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia.

## Management of Acute Severe Bronchial Asthma

### Initial management:

1. **High Flow Oxygen**:
   - Maintain O₂ saturation > 94%.
2. **Short-acting β2-agonists (SABA)**:
   - `salbutamol 2.5 mg/dose for < 5 years & 5 mg/dose for > 5 years` via nebulizer or `salbutamol inhalation` via spacer every 30 minutes for 2 hours, (if not improve: refer to ICU)
3. **Ipratropium bromide**:
   - Add to `salbutamol` for severe cases (combination nebulizer).
4. **Corticosteroids**:
   - Oral or IV `prednisolone` or `hydrocortisone`.
   - Start early for all moderate to severe exacerbations.
5. `Magnesium sulfate (IV)`:
   - In life-threatening asthma or if poor response to initial treatment.

### Complication management:

- `IV Aminophylline`:
  - Consider if not improving with nebulized treatments.
- **Intubation and mechanical ventilation**:
  - In cases of respiratory failure (impending respiratory arrest).

### Discharge plan:

- Continue SABA (`salbutamol`) as needed.
- Start or optimize inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for long-term control.
- Educate parents on:
  - _Correct inhaler technique_.
  - _Asthma action plan_.
  - Avoidance of triggers.

### Follow-up:

- Review after 24-48 hours.
- Long-term control with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
