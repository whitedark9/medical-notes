## Principles of Growth

1. Growth is the **continuous process** starting from conception.
1. Depends on maturation and myelination of the **nervous system**.
1. **Sequence** of growth and development is the same for all children but **rate** of growth is not always uniform.
1. Certain **primitive reflexes** have to be lost before voluntary control development.
1. The **direction** of growth and development is cephalo-caudal.
1. General mass activity given may be replaced by specific individual response.

## Pattern of Growth

### 1. General Type

- The whole body except head and neck follows this pattern.
- Rate of growth is maximum in utero

### 2. Neural Type

- Growth of nervous system is the most rapid during the later months of foetal life and early postnatal life (in the first 2 years)

### 3. Lymphoid Type

- Maximum at 10-12 years and then declines to its adult value

### 4. Genital Type

- Rapid growth with the onset of puberty

## Phases of Somatic Growth

- Three distinct phases of somatic growth in children

|     | Phase     | Growth Pattern                                                                 | Determinant                    |
| :-- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| 1   | Infancy   | Rapid growth of infancy but is less than foetal growth rate                    | Nutrition                      |
| 2   | Childhood | Slow deceleration from 1 year old, except for the mild childhood adrenal spurt | Growth Hormone                 |
| 3   | Puberty   | Pubertal growth spurt                                                          | Sex steroid and growth hormone |

## Factors Influencing Physical Growth and Development

### 1. Genetic

- Phenotypes
  - Parental constitution: Tall parents >>> Tall children
- Race
- Sex
  - Boys: Taller, heavier
- Chromosomal defect (Down's Syndrome)

### 2. Environmental

#### Prenatal Period

1. **Maternal nutrition**
   - Maternal malnutrition
   - Smoking
   - Alcohol
1. **Maternal illnesses**
   - Hypertension, toxemia, irradiation (X-rays)
   - Infection (TORCH)
   - Chronic medical disease (CRF)
1. **Hormones**
   - `Thyroid hormones` does not affect linear growth, it affects skeletal maturation
   - `Insulin` stimulates the foetal growth, Baby of diabetes mother is usually big
   - `Somatomedin` (Insulin like growth factor) deficiency: Small length of baby
   - `Growth hormone`: Not essential for foetal growth in utero

#### Natal Period

- Asphyxia

#### Postnatal Period

1. **Nutrition**
   - PEM
   - Anaemia
   - Vitamin deficiencies
1. **Hormone**: Androgen
1. **Iatrogenic**: Steroid
1. **Trauma**: Fracture of ends of long bones
1. **Infections and infestations**
   - Whooping cough
   - Measles
   - Diarrhoea
   - TB
   - Malaria
   - Various worm infestations
1. **Major organ diseases**
   - CNS
   - Respiratory
   - CVS
   - GI
   - Musculo-skeletal disorder
1. **Socio-pyschological factors**
   - Anxiety, Insecurity, Lack of support and care
   - Children from broken families do not have optimal growth and development
1. **Others**: Children of multiple pregnancies
