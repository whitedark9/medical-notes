- Haematological
  - Leucocytosis with absolute lymphocytosis
- Others
  - Severe PEM
  - Otitis media

  - Frenular ulcer

## Investigation

- **Bacterial**:
  - Per-nasal swab for organism
  - Cough plate culture for organism
- **Haematological**:
  - Total and Differential Count shows leucocytosis with absolute lympocyosis
- **Radiological**:
  - CXR: Perihilar infiltration, actelectasis emphysema
- **ELISA test**:
  - To detect serum IgM, IgG & IgA, pertussis toxin

## Treatment

### Specific

- Antibiotics are effective only in catarrhal stage, reduce transmission if given
  - `Oral Erythromycin 40-50 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided doses for 14 days`

### Supportive Care

## Prevention
