> A 4-year-old child was admitted to the hospital with a history of high continuous fever for 4 days with abrupt fall in temperature and cold clammy extremities on the day of admission. The child was drowsy and Liver was 3.5 cm palpable BP was 60 mmHg palpable only, He did not pass urine since early morning. Discuss the diagnosis and management of this condition. (UM2)

## Features of Shock

1. Abrupt fall in tempterature (usually on or after 3rd day of fever)
1. Sweating
1. Restlessness or drowsiness
1. Cold clammny extremities
1. Rapid thready pulse
1. Capillary refill time > 3 seconds
1. Narrow pulse pressure (< 20 mmHg) or Hypotension
1. Acute abdominal pain

## Severity Grading (WHO Classification)

1. **Grade I**:
   - Fever with positive tourniquet test [^1]
2. **Grade II**:
   - Grade I with spontaneous superficial bleeding
3. **Grade III (DSS Compensated Shock)**:
   - Features of Shock
4. **Grade IV (DSS Hypotensive Shock)**:
   - Profound shock with undetectable blood pressure and pulse

## Management of Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)

### Investigation

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**:
   - Rising hematocrit (due to hemoconcentration).
   - Thrombocytopenia.
2. **Coagulation Profile**:
   - Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT).
3. **Serum electrolytes**:
   - Monitor for electrolyte imbalances, especially hyponatremia.
4. **Blood gases**:
   - Evaluate for metabolic acidosis due to tissue hypoperfusion.
5. **Liver function tests**:
   - Look for elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST).
6. **Chest X-ray / Ultrasound**:
   - Detect pleural effusion or ascites (signs of fluid leakage).

### Treatment

#### Initial Resuscitation (Within the First Hour)

1. **Fluid Resuscitation**:

   - **Rapid IV bolus of isotonic fluids**:
     - **Crystalloids** (`Ringer's lactate` or `0.9% normal saline`) are preferred.
     - Initial bolus: `10–20 mL/kg over 15–30 minutes`.
     - Assess the patient for clinical improvement (improved pulse, BP, capillary refill, warm extremities).
     - If no improvement after the first bolus:
       - Repeat bolus of crystalloids.
       - If the shock persists after two fluid boluses, shift to **colloids**

2. **Colloid Solution** (If crystalloid therapy fails):

   - Administer **colloids** (e.g., `Dextran-40` or `Albumin`) at `10–20 mL/kg over 1 hour`.
   - If shock continues despite colloids:
     - Increase infusion rate and consider **inotropic agents** (e.g., `dopamine`, `norepinephrine`).

3. **Blood Transfusion**:
   - Indicated if there is **significant bleeding** or **hemoglobin drops <7 g/dL**.
   - Transfuse **whole blood** or **packed red cells** to maintain adequate hemoglobin and oxygen delivery.

#### Ongoing Management and Monitoring

1. **Monitor for signs of fluid overload**:

   - As fluid leakage into tissues subsides (usually after 24–48 hours), excess fluid may cause pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
   - Monitor the patient’s **weight, urine output, respiratory rate**, and **chest auscultation**.

2. **Vital Signs**:

   - Continuous monitoring :**blood pressure (BP)**, **pulse**, and **oxygen saturation**.
   - Then, reduce frequency as the patient stabilizes.

3. **Urine Output**:

   - Monitor **hourly urine output**:
     - Target: `≥0.5–1 mL/kg/hour for adults` and `≥1 mL/kg/hour for children`.
   - Use a **urinary catheter** if necessary to ensure accurate measurement.

4. **Hematocrit Monitoring**:

   - **Hematocrit measurements** every 4–6 hours initially.
   - Rising hematocrit indicates ongoing plasma leakage

5. **Electrolyte and Glucose Monitoring**:
   - Monitor **serum sodium**, **potassium**, and **glucose** frequently to prevent and manage electrolyte imbalances or hypoglycemia.

#### Management of Complications

1. **Inotropic Support**:

   - If the patient develops **profound shock** that is resistant to fluid therapy:
     - Use **inotropes** (e.g., `dopamine` at 5–10 mcg/kg/min or `norepinephrine` infusion).

2. **Bleeding**:

   - Correct coagulopathy by administering:
     - **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)** if there is `active bleeding` or significantly deranged coagulation profiles.
     - **Platelet transfusion** if `platelet count <10,000 cells/mm³` or in the presence of bleeding.

3. **Electrolyte and Acid-Base Correction**:

   - **Slow sodium correction**: `hyponatremia`
   - **Bicarbonate**: `metabolic acidosis`

4. **Oxygen Therapy**:
   - **Oxygen** via nasal cannula or mask
   - **Mechanical ventilation**: **Respiratory failure** or severe pulmonary edema

#### Recovery Phase (After 24-48 Hours)

- **Fluid tapering**:

  - As plasma leakage decreases, **reduce IV fluid rates** to avoid fluid overload.
  - **Monitor for signs of recovery**:
    - Stable pulse, normalizing BP, good urine output, decreasing hematocrit.

- **Diuretics**:
  - **Fluid overload** (e.g., pulmonary edema): **diuretics** such as `furosemide`.

### Prevention

1. Prevention of mosquito bite at day time
   - Use of insecticide
   - Wearing protective clothes
   - Use of mosquito nets and screens
2. Removal of breeding places
   - Use of larvicide
   - Clear flower vases
   - Removal of all possible areas where water can collect

## Tourniquet Test

> To assess capillary fragility

1. Patient should be relaxed, sitting position.
2. Measure blood pressure
3. Inflate a blood pressure cuff to a pressure midway between systolic and diastolic values
4. Maintain the pressure for **5 minutes**
5. Realse the cuff, wait for **1 minute**
6. Count the number of petechiae that appear in a `1 inch square` or `2.5 cm2` area on the skin below the cuff (forearm)

- Positive Test:
  - \> 10 petechiae per area at maximum site of petechiae
  - \> 20 peteachiae per area (Definitely positve)
- Negative Test:
  - < 10 petechiae per are
