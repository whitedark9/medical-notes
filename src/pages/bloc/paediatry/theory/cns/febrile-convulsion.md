1. Febrile convulsion
1. Pyogenic meningitis
1. Tuberculus meningitis

## Diagnosis

### Typical Features of Febrile Convulsion

- **Age**: between 6 months and 5 years (peak - 1-2 years)
- **Sex**: Boys affect more than girls.
- **Onset**: Occurs within 24 hours of onset of fever, especially with the rising phase of a fever. (Temperature 39Â°C or more)
- **Character**: Generalized tonic or clonic or tonic clonic fits, no focal features.
- **Duration**: Less than 15 minutes
- **After fits**: No residual neurological deficits like drowsiness or paresis
- **Family history**: Positive family history of febrile convulsions

## Management

### 1. First aid measures for seizure

- Semi-prone **position**
- Check airway, breathing, circulation (**ABC**)
- Adequate airway and suction
- Clothing must be loosened. Excess clothing removed.
- Don't put anything into the mouth.
- To control fits if more than 4 minutes
  - `PR Diazepam - 0.3-0.5 mg/kg`
  - `IM Phenobarbitone - 10-20 mg/kg`

### 2. Control fever

- Tepid sponging
- `Antipyretic` e.g. `oral or rectal Paracetamol 15mg/kg 4-6 hourly`

### 3. Hospitalization

> Not all children need to be admitted.

The main reasons for admission are:

- To exclude intracranial pathology especially infection
- Fear of recurrent fits.
- To investigate and treat the cause of fever
- To reduce parents' anxiety, especially if they are staying far from the hospital

### 4. Exclusiong of other intracranial causes of fits

- **Meningitis**: Signs of meningism, tense or buldging anterior fontanelle, prolonged or frequent fits(check full blood count, lumber puncture)
- **Encephalitis**: Change in sensorium, neurological signs may be present.
- **Cerebral malaria**: Came from or travelled to malaria endemic area, change in sensorium (check malaria parasites)

Lumber puncture should be considered in the following conditions:

- Any signs suspicious of meningitis
- <12 months old with first febrile seizure

### 5. Counselling

Parents should be counseled on the benign nature of this condition.

### 6. Advice

Parents should also be advised on first aid measures during a consulsion.

### 7. Prophylaxis

- ~~Not recommended~~: Long term prophylaxis with daily anticonvulsants even if episodes are frequent.
- **Recommend**: Intermittent prophylaxis (e.g., `oral diazepam at the start of temperature and every 8 hours for 24 hours only`) can be considered for such children with frequent episodes.
