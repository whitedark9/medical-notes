## Causes of Neonatal Jaundice by Day of Onset

| Day of Onset     | Causes                                     |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------- |

|                  | - Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia           |

## Phototherapy

> Phototherapy is a treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight)

### Indications

1. In the **term baby**, `serum bilirubin level > 15 mg%`
2. In the **preterm baby**, `serum bilirubin level > 10-12 mg%` but adjusted by gestational age or body weight
3. Before exchange transfusion, for prevention of further rise of serum bilirubin.

### Methods

- Blue tube photo (wavelength 450-475 nm) is better than white light (ordinary day light fluorescent)
- 4 or 6 in numbers of 2 feet or 4 feet fluorescent tube 18 inches from the cot or incubator
- Photothehrapy should be given continuously except feeding & toileting
- Expose the whole body. Cover the eyes.
- Turn the baby every 2-3 hours.

Extra fluid - `20-30 ml/kg/24hour` is given by more frequent breastfeeding.

### Complications

1. **Retinal damage** - Retinopathy - Blindness
1. **Hyperthermia/Hypothermia**
1. **Fluid loss** - Dehydration
1. **Diarrhoea** due to isomers which are hygroscopic
1. **Skin rashes** due to histamine release
1. **Bronze baby syndrome** if phototherapy is given to the patient with conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

## Exchange Transfusion

> An exchange transfusion is a blood transfusion in which the patient's blood or components of it are exchanged with other blood or blood products.

### Indications

1. Rule of thumb: `Term > 20 mg%`
2. Use bilirubin charts according to birth weight, gestational age, age of the baby
3. Consider exchange at lower serum bilirubin level if the baby has `hypoxia`, `hypoglycaemia`, `hypothermia`, `asphyxia`, `septicaemia`
4. Rate of rise of serum bilirubin is `> 1 mg%/hour` or `> 5 mg%/day`
5. Severe clinical jaundice associated with `imparied Moro's reflex`, `refusal to feed` and `lethargy` (impending bilirubin encephalopathy)

### Complications

1. Catheter induced
   - Infection (portal pyaemia)
   - Air & blood clot thrombosis and embolism
   - Arrhythmia
2. Metabolic changes
   - Hyperglycemia followed by rebound hypoglycemia
   - Hypocalcemia
   - Acidosis
   - Hyperkalaemia
3. Incorrect calculation
   - Hypervolaemia
   - Hypovolaemia
4. Necrotizing enterocolitis
5. Hazards of blood transfusion including infections:
   - Syphilis
   - CMV
   - HIV
   - Hepatits B, C
   - Malaria infections
