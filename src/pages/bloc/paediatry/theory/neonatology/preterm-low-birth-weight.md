## Definition

> Preterm are infants born less than 37 weeks of gestation.

> Low birth weight are infants whose birth weight is < 2.5kg (5 lbs 8 ounces)
> Very low birth weight (VLBW) are < 1.5 kg
> Extreme low birth weight (ELBW) are < 1 kg

## Complications of Preterm, Low Birth Weight

### Short-term Complication

#### 1. Central Nervous System

- **Periventricular haemorrhage** especially < 33 weeks due to immature brain and fragile vassals

#### 2. Respiratory System

- **Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)** due to deficiency of surfactant
- **Apnoea of prematurity**
- **Risk of aspiration** when associated with poor coordinated sucking and swallowing due to poor gag and cough reflex

#### 3. Cardiovascular System

- **Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)**: the ductus may remain patent or reopen (Most common with RDS)

#### 4. Gastrointestinal System

- **Paralytic ileus**: Resolve spontaneously
- **Necrotizing enterocolitis**: Serious illness. Presents the classical triad of abdominal distention, bile stained aspirates and bloody mucousy stools.

#### 5. Haematologic

- **Hyperbilirubinaemia**: due to immature liver
- **Anaemia**: due to erythropoietin deficieny
- **Vitamin E deficiency**

#### 6. Metabolic

- **Hpyothermia**: due to reduced subcutaneous fat stores & less well developed brown fat stores
- **Hypoglycaemia**: due to deficient glycogen stores at birth
- **Late hyponatremia**: due to high renal sodium loss and low intake
- **Rickets of prematurity**: due to increased demand by rapid postnatal growth

#### 7. Immunologic

- **Low immune**

### Long-term Complications

#### 1. Retinopathy of prematurity

- **Immature retina** in infants < 32 weeks of gestation or < 1.5 kg birth weight

#### 2. Major handicaps

- Cerebal palsy
- Mental retardation
- Language disorders
- Learning disabilities
- Hyperactivity
- Cognitive delay

#### 3. Sensory impairments

- Hearing defects
- Squint and visual defects

#### 4. Poor growth

## Management of Preterm Infants

### 1. Temperature Control

- Maintain adequate body temperature. (Skin temperature 36.5-37.5°C)
- Switch on the lamp, radiant warmer, or incubator before the birth of the baby
- Dry immediately, Discard the wet towel, Wrap in a warm,dry and clean towel
- Keep under overhead radiant warmer before transfer to SCBU
- Maintain temperature during transport. Use transport incubator for VLBWs.
- Precaution to prevent hypothermia in SCBU
- Generally for preterm nursing, room temperature should be 28-29°C, environmental humidity 50%

### 2. Nutritional Management

Coordinated sucking and swallowing at 34-35 weeks gestation only

Initiation of feeding

- **< 1.5kg**: No oral feed, Put an IV line
- **> 1.5kg, > 32 weeks & up to 1.8 kg**: Enteral feed if no contraindcations such as ill, respiratory distress, etc.

Consider:

1. Choice of feed
1. Route of feeding
1. Schedule of feeding

#### Preferred Milk

##### Choice

- **Preterm mother's milk**
  - It has higher electroyte and protent for rapid growth of the baby
  - It has anti-bodies and anti-infective factors for survival of a preterm baby

##### Route

- Mother express her own milk into a sterile container
- **< 32 weeks**: are given intragastric feeding (orogastirc or nasogastri)
- **32-34 weeks**: Babies who can swallow are fed with spoon.
- **34-36 weeks**: Babies can suck well the nipples. If they get tired, fed with spoon or cup.

##### Schedule

Feeding should be scheduled because preterms rarely demand for feeds.

- **< 1kg**: need hourly feeding
- **1kg-1.5kg**: need 2 hourly feeding
- **1.5kg**: 3 hourly feeding

#### Vitamin Supplements

- All preterm babies must receive `IM Vit K1` after birth to prevent haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
- **Dose**: `0.5 mg` for < 34 weeks of gestation, `1 mg` for > 34 weeks

#### Multivitamins and Folic Acide

- **Multivitamins**: starts from Day 7-14
- **Folic acid**: `1 mg/day` from Day 7-14 till 3 months of age

#### Iron

- **Iron supplementation**: `2mg/kg` starts ony at 6-8 weeks after birth

### 3. Fluid and Electrolyte Management

- Weight daily
- Check Urine output and physical examination

#### Day 1

- `Plain dextrose`
- `10% dextrose` for newborn
- `7.5% dextrose` for preterms, especially ELBW because they tolerate poorly

#### Day 2 onwards

- Depends on changes in body weight, renal function and serum electrolyte
- From Day 2 onwards:
  - `10% dextrose in 0.18% saline` for > 1kg
  - `7.5% dextrose in 0.18% saline` for < 1kg
- Oral feeds starts when no abdominal distention with audible bowel sounds
- Oral feeds are slowly increased and IVs are gradually withdrawn

### 4. Haematologic and Jaundice Management

- `Blood transfusion` for anaemia in critically ill neonates to keep the Htc above 40% at all times
- **Anaemia of prematurity**: usually presents at about 6 weeks of age
- **Hyperbilirubinaemia**: Close observation for development of jaundice

### 5. Prevention of Infection

- Wash hand and arm before and after handling babies
- Avoid overcrowding
- Practice minimal handling of infants
- Adequate staffing
- Isolation of infected babies
- Proper cleaning and maintenance of nursery
- Encourgae beastfeeding

### 6. Prevention and Management of Hypoglycaemia

- Prevention of hypoglycaemia is essential
- Close monitoring of blood glucse levels with early initiation of feeding
- Breastfed babies needs prefed blood glucose check for the first 48 hours
