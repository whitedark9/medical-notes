# Acute Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis

> A 8 year old previously healthy child was admitted to the hospital for generalized oedema for 1 week duration. On examination he was generally well, afebrile and not dyspnoeic. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. What investigations will you do for this child? What is the most likely diagnosis? Discuss briefly the management of this child. (UM1)

> Discuss clinical features, complications, investigations and management of acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis? (UM2)

> Compare and contrast acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome.

## Clinical Features

History of **upper respiratory tract infection** or **skin infection** approximately **2 weeks prior to the onset** of

1. Rapid onset of
   - Puffiness around the eyes and pedal edema (first symptom)
   - Smokey red urine
   - Oliguria
2. Features of hypertension:
   - Headache
   - Vomiting
   - Photophobia

## Complications

1. Acute renal failure
2. Hypertensive heart failure
3. Hypertensive encephalopathy

## Investigation

### Urine RE

- Macroscopy
  - Smoky red urine
  - Proteins 1+ or 2+
- Microscopy
  - Red cells casts
  - Granular casts

### Blood Examination

- Blood Urea - raised
- Serum creatinine - raised
- Blood for CP - nomocytic anemia [^1]
- Blood electrolytes - Hyperkalaemia
- ASO titre - raised
- Throat swab culture & sensitivity - (+)ve for streptococcal infection

[^1]: **Nomocytic anemia**: Normal size RBCs but decrease in amount due to blood loss

## Managment of AGN

### Non-specific Treatment

#### Anti-microbial therapies to eradicate the streptococci

- `IM Penicillin 25,000-50,000 unit/kg for 7-10 days`
- Alternative: `Erythromycin 30-50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses`

#### Monitoring

- Daily intake-ouput chart
- Daily urine albumin chart
- Daily body weight chart
- Blood pressure chart (BD/4 hourly/6 hourly)

#### Diatery management

- Restriction of pretein if blood urea is > 75mg
- Restriction of potassium and sodium

#### Fluid Restriction

- 1/2 or 1/3 of previous day output + insensible loss

### Treatment of Hypertension

#### Mild/Moderate Hypertension

- `Nifedipine 0.25 mg/kg/dose (Oral or subligual)` can be repeated in 2-4 hours if necessary
- `Hydralazine IV/Oral`
- **Gradual reduction in blood pressure is important**

### Treatment of Hypertensive Encephalopathy

To reduce BP to upper limit of normal range over 48-72 hours

- First line of treatment: `Subingual Nifedipine`
- `IV Frusemide 1-2 mg/kg/dose`
- `Sodium nitroprusside` or `Labetalol IV infusion 1-3 mg/kg/hour`
- **Gradual reduction in blood pressure is important**

### Supportive Treatment

- `Dialysis` for **acute renal failure with severe hypertension**
- Control of **seizures** by `anticonvulsant drugs`
- Treat **cerebral oedema** with `diuretics or mannitol`

## Prognosis

- Excellent - Complete recovery > 95%
- Recurrence - Extremely rare
