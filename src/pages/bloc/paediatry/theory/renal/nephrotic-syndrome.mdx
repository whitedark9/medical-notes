# Nephrotic Syndrome

> Discuss clinical features, complications, investigations and management of nephrotic
> syndrome? (UMMG)

> A 4-year-old previously healthy child was admitted to the hospital for generalized oedema for 1 week duration. On examination he was generally well, afebrile and not dyspneic. His blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg.What investigations will you do in this child? What is the most likely diagnosis? Discuss briefly the management of this child. (UMTG)

## Diagnostic Criteria

> Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes the body excrete too much protein in the urine.

Characterized by :

1. **Massive proteinuria** (Increase protein in the urine)
2. **Hypoalbuminaemia** (Decrease protein in the blood)
3. **Generalized pitting edema**
4. **Hypercholesterolaemia** (Hyperlipidaemia)

## Clinical Features

- **Age**: Peak incidence in preschool children
- **Sex**: Male > Female (2:1)
- **Timing**: Initial episode and subsequent relapses may occur after a viral infection (URTI)
- **Onset**: Generalized edema develops over several weeks
  - Initially noted around the eyes
  - Lower extremities (pitting edema)
  - Associated with weight gain
  - Ascites
  - Pleural effusion

## Complications

1. Infection
   - Pneumococcal infection: Peritonitis and pneumonia
   - Flare up of TB
   - Urinary tract infection (UTI)
2. Thrombosis [^1]
3. Hypovolemic shock [^2]
   - Abdominal pain
   - Cold and clammy extremities
   - Weak pulse pressure
   - Hypotension
4. Complications of steroid therapy such as:
   - Hypertension
   - Growth retardation
   - Cataract

[^1]: **Thrombosis**: Anticoagulant protein loss in urine → Liver produces more proteins → Increase clotting factors | Dehydration → Increase packed cell volume → Thrombosis
[^2]: **Hypovolemic shock**: Massive proteinuria → Decrease protein (albumin) in blood → Decrease oncotic pressure → Fluid shifts from intravascular space (vessels) to interstitial space (between cells and vessels) → `Intravascular hypovolemic shock`

## Investigation

### Urine RE

- Macroscopic: Clear and colorless
- Microsopci: Heavy proteinuria, Hyaline casts
- Urine for culture and sensitivity

### Blood Tests

- Blood total and differential protein: Low serum albumin
- Blood urea and electrolyte: Usually normal
- Blood cholesterol: Increase
- Complement level: normal
- Renal biopsy

#### Indications for Renal Biopsy

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji=''>

- **Age of onset**: < 6 months or > 12 years
- Persistent microscopic **haematuria**
- Initial macroscopic **haematuria** at any age
- Persistent **hypertension**
- Persistent low serum **complement C3**
- **Proteinuria** despite 4 weeks daily steroid therapy (Steroid resistance)

</Callout>

### Monitoring

- Daily intake-ouput chart
- Daily urine albumin chart
- Daily body weight chart
- Blood pressure chart (BD/4 hourly/6 hourly)

## Management

### Management of Steroid Responsive Nephrotic Syndrome

#### 1. Initial Episode

##### Diet

- Restriction of sodium
- Restriction of fluid - Output of previous day + Insensible loss
- Normal protein diet with adequate calories for age

##### Steroid

- `60 mg/m2/day single dose or 4 divided doses for at least 4 consecutive weeks` followed by
- `40 mg/m2/day single morning dose alternative day for 28 days` and then slowly tapered and discontinued over the next 2-3 months

##### Albumin

- Low serum albumin alone is not an indication.
- **Indications**:
  - Clinical hypovolemia
  - Symptomatic edema
- `20% albumin 1 g/kg over 4-6 hours`

##### Diuretic

- **Indications**: Severe edema
- `Furosemide 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided dose`

##### Penicillin

- **Indications**: To prevent pneumococcal infection
- `Pencillin V 125 mg BD (< 5 years) and 250 mg BD (> 5 years)` until remission occurs

---

#### 2. Relapse

- Relapse may be triggered by infection, allergic events
- Relapse rate - 60%
- **For first 2 relapses**:
  - `Prednisolone 60 mg/m2/day divided dose` until remission followed by
  - `40 mg/m2 alternate day` and tapered over 1-2 months
- **Frequent relapses**:
  - `Prednisolone maintenance 0.5 mg/kg alternate day` for up to 12 months

---

#### 3. Steroid Dependent

Use other immunosuppressive drugs

1. `Levamisole` 2.5 mg/kg alternate day for 4-12 months
2. Oral `cyclophosphamide` 2-3 mg/kg/day single dose for 2-3 months
3. High dose pulse `methylprednisolone`
4. `Cyclosporin`
5. `Mycophenol-atemofitil` (MMF)

##### Indication for Immunosuppressive Therapy

<Callout emoji="">

- Steroid dependent patients
- Frequent relapsers
- The children who suffers severe corticosteroid toxicity

</Callout>

##### Immunization in Children with Nephrotic Syndrome

- ~~Live vaccine can be administered 6 weeks after cessation of steroid therapy~~
