## Clinical Features of PEM

### Kwashiorkor

#### Four cardinal criteria

1. Generalized pitting oedema
1. Psychological changes
   - Apathetic
   - Miserable
   - Irritable
1. Muscle wasting with some retention of subcutaneous fat
1. Growth retardation (60-80% of weight for age)

#### Other features

1. Skin changes
   - Hypopigmentation
   - Hyperpigmentaton
   - Desquamation and ulceration
   - Crazy pavement dermatosis
   - Fissures and blisters
1. Hair changes
   - Thin, dry, silky, depigmented areas of pigmentd and depigmented segments (Flag sign)
1. Liver enlargement
1. Haematological changes
   - Iron deficiency anaemia
   - Folic acid deficiency
1. Signs and symptoms of vitamin deficiencies

### Marasmus

#### Characteristic features

1. Growth retardation (< 60% of weight for age)
1. Muscle wasting
1. Loss of subcutaneous fat

#### Other features [#marasmus]

1. Old man facies
1. Hungry looking, listless, anxious
1. Sleep very poorly
1. Mucus diarrhoea (hunger diarrhoea)

### Marasmic-Kwashiorkor

#### Characteristic features

1. Growth retardation
1. Oedema
1. Muscle wasting
1. Loss of subcutaneous fat

## 10 Essential Steps in Management of PEM

import { Steps } from "nextra/components";

<Steps>

### Treat/Prevent Hypoglycaemia

- Give `50 mls of 10% glucose or sucrose solution` orally or by nasogastric tube followed by the first feed
- Give 2 hourly feeds, day and night

### Treat/Prevent Hypothermia

- If axillary temperature is < 35°C (95°F), feed the child immediately and rewarm the child

### Treat/Prevent Dehydration

- ~~Do not use IV route except in shock~~
- Give `ReSoMal 5ml/kg` every 30 min for 2 hours orally or by nasogastric tube
- Then, `5-10 ml/kg/hr` for next 4-10 hours
- Replace ReSoMal doses at 6th and 10th with equal amount of `F-75 formula`

### Correct Electrolyte Imbalance

- Give extra `potassium 3-4 mmol/kg/day `
- Give extra `magnesium 0.4-0.6 mmol/kg/day `
- `Low sodium rehydration fluid` (e.g., ReSoMal)
- Prepare `food without salt`

### Treat/Prevent Infection

- Give routinely `broad-spectrum antibiotics`
- If no complication, give `Co-trimoxazole orally` twice daily for 5 days
- If the child is severely ill or complications, give `Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IM/IV and Gentamycin 7.5 mg/kg IM/IV` once daily for 7 days
- `Measles vaccination` if the child is > 9 months and not immunized

### Correct Micronutrient Deficiencies

- Give daily multivitamin supplement
- `Folic acid` 1 mg/day (5 mg on Day 1)
- `Zinc` 2 mg/kg/day
- `Copper` 2 mg/kg/day
- Once weight gain is observed, give `iron` 3 mg/kg/day
- `Vitamin A` orally on Day 1
  - \> 1 year: Give 200,000 IU
  - 6-12 months: Give 100,000 IU
  - 0-5 months: Give 50,000 IU

### Initiate Refeeding

- Give small frequent feeds of low osmolarity and low lactose formula
- Oral or nasogastric feeds 100 kcal/kg/day
- 1-1.5 g of `protein`/kg/day
- 130 ml/kg/day of `Starter F-75` (100 ml/kg/day if child has oedema) (F-75 means 100 ml of F-75 includes calorie 75 in protein 0.9 G)
- If the child is breastfed, continue to breastfed but give Starter formula first

### Facilitate Catch-up Growth

- Return of appetite is a sign for entering the rehabilitation phase
- Replace Starter F-75 with the same amount of catch-up formula `F-100` for 48 hour (F-100 means 100 ml of F-100 includes calorie 100 in protein 2.9 G)
- 4-6 g/kg/day of `protein`
- Then, increase each successive feed by 10 ml until some feed remains uneaten

### Provide Sensory Stimulation and Emotional Support

- Provide tender loving care
- Provide a cheerful stimulating environment
- Provide structured play therapy
- Provide physical activity as soon as the child is well enough
- Provide maternal involvement when possible

### Prepare for Follow-up after Recovery

- `A child who is 90% weight for length` can be considere to have recovered
- `Good feeding` practices and `sensory stimulation` should be continued at home
- Show the parents
  - `How to feed` frequently with energy rich and nutrient dense food
  - How to give `structured play therapy`
- Ask the parent to bring the child back for `regular follow up` at 1, 2 and 4 weeks, then monthly for 6 months

## Prevention of PEM

1. Proper breast feeding
1. Growth monitoring and early referral
1. Timely and proper weaning practices
1. Immunization
1. Birth spacing
1. Female education
