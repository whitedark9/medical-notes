# Infective Endocarditis

> An infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, typically involving the heart valves, characterized by the formation of vegetations composed of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms on the valve leaflets

## Common Causal Organisms

1. _Streptococcus viridan group_ (leading cause in child)
1. _Staphylococcus aureus_ (leading cause in child)
1. _Streptococcus fecalis_ (enterococcus)

## Pathophysiology

### Endothelial Damage

- **Damage to endothelium of heart valves or endocardium of heart** → Exposure of underlying layers → Platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition at the site of injury → Formation of sterile (non-bacterial) thrombotic vegetation → A place for bacterial colonization → Bacteria causes more growth of vegetation → Dense layer of fibrin and platelet protects the bacteria from host immune system and antibiotic penetration → Inflammation of the heart valve

### Heart

- Damage to heart valves → Acute or chronic valvular insufficiency → `Heart failure`
- (1) Vegetation growth, (2) Valve damage, (3) Embolization, (4) New valve involvement → `Changing murmur`

### Deposition of Immune Complexes

- Presence of bacteria in the bloodstream → Formation of circulating immune complexes → Deposition of immune complexes in other tissues (`Glomerulonephritis`, `Vasculitis lesion`)

### Distant Organs Involvements

- Spread of bacteria into other organs → `Secondary infection` (Osteomyelitis, Septic arthritis, Psoas abscess)
- Pieces of vegetation can break off and embolize distant organs (`Cerebral emboli`, `Pulmonary emboli`, `Systemic emboli`)
- Presence of bacteria toxins and cytokines in the bloodstream → `Fever`, `Chills & Rigor`, `Night sweats`, `Malaise`

## Clinical Features

### History

- `Congenital heart disease`
- `Rheumatic heart diseases`
- Preceding dental/other surgical procedure, Central venous catheter, Prosthetic heart valve

### Features of Bacteraemia

- Fever (usually low grade)
- Rigor
- Malaise
- Weakness
- Loss of appetite, Weight loss
- Night sweat
- Splenomegaly [^1]
- Anaemia [^2]
- Tinge of jaundice [^3]
- Myalgia, Arthralgia [^4]

[^1]: **Enlargement of Spleen**: (1) Immune Response, (2) Septic Emboli, (3) Chronic Infection
[^2]: **Anaemia**: (1) Destruction of RBCs by bacterial toxins, (2) Inhibition of erythropoiesis in bone marrow by inflammatory cytokines and glomerunephritis
[^3]: **Jaundice**: Increase unconjugated bilirubin in the blood ← Metabolized from hemoglobin ← Breakdown of RBCs
[^4]: **Myalgia, Arthralgia**: (1) Due to immune complex deposition, (2) Inflammatory cytokines, (3) Septic arthritis

### Haemodynamic Changes (Due to underlying heart disease)

- Changing murmur
- Heart failure
- Arrhythmia [^5]

[^5]: **Arrhythmia**: Inflammation, Valvular damage interrupt the cardiac conduction system

### Systemic Embolization

- **Neurologic complications** (embolic strokes, cerebral `abscesses`, mycotic `aneurysms`, sudden blindness [^6]) often associated with _staphylococcal_ disease
- Splenic or myocardial infarct, ischemic limbs, mycotic arterial `aneurysm` and metastatic `abscesses` (meninges, pericardium, bone and joint)

[^6]: Sudden blindness: Retinal artery occlusion by pieces of vegetation

### Immune Complex Disease / Vasculitis

- Classic skin findings include `splinter haemorrhage` (linear lesions beneath nails), `Osler's nodes` (tender nodules in digit pads), `Janeway lesions` (painless erythema/hemorrhage, palms and soles)
- Petechiae and clubbing
- Other manifestations are `splenomegaly`, `glomerulonephritis` and `arthritis`

## Investigations

1. **Blood culture 3 times**: within 24 hours at different sites, after careful preparations
1. **Blood for CP**: Normochromic normocytic anaemia, Polymorphonuclear leucocytosis
1. **ESR and CRP**: Increased
1. **Urine RE**: Microscopic haematuria and albuminuriamay be seen
1. **Echocardiogram** for presence of vegetations, reduced LV function, absence of vegetations does not exclude infective endocarditis
1. **Immunological changes**: Increase in gamma globulin, false positive STS, Rheumatoid factor

## Differential Diagnosis

1. Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
1. Nephritis
1. Anaemia: Malaria
1. Autoimmune diseases

## Complications

1. Heart failure (from mitral and aortic valve vegetations)
1. Embolization (systemic + pulmonary)
1. Effects of anaemia
1. Endotoxaemic shock [^7]

[^7]: **Endotoxaemic shock** = Septic shock: Systemic inflammatory response to bacterial toxins

## Management

### Treatment of the Current Episode

Main principles consist of -

1. Starting the empirical treatment as early as possible
1. Identification of the organism
1. Finding out the antibiotic sensitivity
1. Using high doses of bactericidal antimicrobial agents for a long period to eradicate organisms in inaccessible avascular vegetations and prevent relapse

### Antibiotics

- High dose, `IV Crystalline Penicillin 1 Lakh/kg/dose 6 hourly for 4-6 weeks and Gentamycin 2.5mg/kg/dose 8 hourly for 2 weeks`
- For _Staphylococus aureus_, `IV Cloxacillin 25mg/kg/dose 6 hourly for 4-6 weeks`

### Pophylactic Measures (Prevention of Endocarditis)

- Dental hygeine and antibiotic prophylaxis before tooth extraction, surgical procedures
- **Tooth extraction**: `Amoxycillin 50 mg/kg 1 hour before, 25 mg/kg 6 hours after 1st dose`
- **Genitourinary procedures**: `Injection Ampicillin 50 mg/kg 1/2 hour before precedure, then 8 hours later`, `Injection Gentamycin 2 mg/kg 1/2 hour before procedure, then 8 hours later`

### Pen allergic or On Continuous Penicillin Prophylaxis

- **Minor procedure**: `Oral Clindamycin 20mg/kg (600 mg max) 1 hour before, not to repeat` or `Oral Azithromycin 15 mg/kg 1 hour before`
- **Major procedure**: `IV Clindamycin 10 mg/kg (300 mg max) within 30 min before, no repeat` + `IV/IM Gentamycin 2 mg/kg (100 mg max) within 30 min before and 8 hour later`
- Prompt treatment of any infections in patient with heart disease
