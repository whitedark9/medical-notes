## Causes of Heart Failure

> Con Com Rheu Rheu Beri Beri အပေါ် အပေါ် My Car အနီး(Anae)

1. **Con**genital heart diseases
1. **Com**plication of pneumonia
1. Acute **rheu**matic carditis
1. Established **rheu**matic heart diseases
1. **Beri beri**
1. Acute **hyper**tension due to acute glomerulonephritis
1. Supraventricular **tachy**cardia (SVT)
1. Viral **my**ocarditis
1. **Car**diomyopathies
1. Severe **anae**mia

## Definition

> Immunological disorder initiated by Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis/tonsillitis

## Causes

- M proteins of GAS share structural similarities with certain human tissues (e.g. heart, joint, skin, brain)
- The immune system generates antibodies against the M protein of GAS.
- Due to molecular similarities, these antibodies cross-react with human tissues and attack the host's cells
- Rheumatic fever affects mostly heart, joint, skin and brain

## Jones Criteria

> To make diagnosis, patient must have `2 major criteria` **OR** `1 major and 2 minor criteria` **AND** `evidence of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) recent infection`

### Major Criteria

> **CANCER**: C-**C**arditis, A-Migratory Poly**a**rthritis, N-Subcutaneous **N**odule, C-**C**horea, Er-**Er**ythema Marginatum

#### Migratory Polyarthritis (about 70%)

- Large joints (elblows, wrists, knees, ankles) - Does not result in chronic joint disease
- Inflammatory signs (_ရောင်, နီ, နာ, ပူ_) (swelling, redness, pain, warmth, exquisitely tenderness)

#### Carditis

- Pancarditis that involves pericardium, myocardium and endocardium (major consequence of chronic progressive valvular disease)
- **Endocarditis** (valvulitis)
  1. `Mitral Regurgitation`: Apical pansystolic murmur radiating to axilla
  1. `Mitral Stenosis`
  1. `Aortic Insufficiency`: High pitched early diastolic murmur at the upper left sternal border
- **Myocarditis**
  - Cardiomegaly
  - Soft first heart sound
  - Tachycardia
  - Gallop rhythm [^1]
  - Congestive heart failure
- **Pericarditis**
  - Precordial pain
  - Friction rub [^2] (superficial scratchy sound)

[^1]: Gallop rhythm: Additional heart sound (S3 or S4), Rapid ventricular filling (S3), Atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle (S4)
[^2]: Friction rub: Abnormal heart sound characterized by a grating, scratching, or rubbing noise, caused by inflammation of pericardium

#### Chorea

- `Sydenham's chorea`: Purposeless, non-repetitive, jerky involuntary movements of proximal part of limbs
- **Concidence**:
  - 3-4 times more common in females
  - Occurs much later than other manifestations
- Emotional liability, Incoordination, Poor school performance, Uncontrollable movements and facial grimacing
- **Exacerbation factor**: Stress
- **Reliefing factor**: Disappear with sleep
- **Progress**:
  - Self limiting course of 2-6 weeks
  - Rarely leads to permanent neurological sequalae

#### Erythema Marginatum (rare < 3%)

- Characteristic rash consists of erythematous, serpiginous, macular lesions with pale centers that are not pruritic
- **Site**: Occurs primarily on the trunk and extremities, but not on the face

![Erythema Marginatum Form](/cvs/em-forms.jpg)

#### Subcutaneous nodules (rare < 1%)

- Most common in patients with severe carditis
- **Size**: Pea-sized
- **Rigidity**: Firm and non-tender
- **Site**: Extensor surfaces of the tendons near bony prominences such as elbows, knees, shins, occiput and spine

### Minor Criteria

> **FACE**: F-**F**ever, A-**A**rthralgia, C-**C**-reactive protein, E-**ESR**, **ECG**

#### Two Clinical Manifestations

1. **Fever**: Usually not more than 101-102F
1. **Arthralgia**: Discomfort or pain, no inflammation

#### Two Laboratory Manifestations

1. **Acute phase reactants**: Increase ESR, Increase C-reactive protein (CRP)
1. **Prolong PR interval on ECG**

#### Evidance of recent Group A Streptococcal infection

- Raised ASO titre (> 333 Todd's units) or rising titre
- Positive throat culture
- Rapid streptococcal antigen test

## Investigations

1. Throat swab culture
1. ASO titre
1. Acute phase reaction: ESR, CRP
1. **ECG**: prolonged PR interval [^3]
1. **CXR**: Cardiomegaly in significant carditis
1. **Echocardiogram**: Valvular regurgitation in Doppler, mitral and aortic valves may be affected

[^3]: Carditis → Inflammation around the AV node and other conduction pathway → Slow down the electrical impulse transmission → Prolonged PR interval

## Complications

- Acute heart failure
- Chronic valvular heart disease

## Treatment

- No specific treatment
- Symptomatic combined with suppressive therapy

### General

- Bed rest during the acute phase until disease activity stops (normal temperature and pulse rate)
- Patient without carditis can be ambulatory in 2-3 weeks
- If carditis is present, it may be continued for 2-3 months

### Treatment of Arthritis

- NSAIDS (Anti-inflammatory action) [^4]: `Salicylates (Aspirin) 100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses Orally`, reduced to 1/3 with clinical response, taper over 2 weeks when CRP, ESR normalizes

[^4]: NSAIDS: Anti-inflammatory, Pain relief

### Treatment of Carditis

- Steroid [^5]: `Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses Orally over 2-3 weeks` followed by tapering doses (reduce 5 mg/24 hour every 2-3 days)
- **Indication**
  - Moderate to severe carditis or cardiac failure
  - Anti-inflammatory action
  - Treatment of heart failure if present

[^5]: Steroid: Reduce immune system, Reduce inflammation

### Treatment of Chorea

- Sedation: `Diazepam (mild cases)`, `Haloperidol (severe cases)`, or `Sodium Valporate`
- Prevent trauma
- Reassurance

### Treatment of Sore Throat

Eradication of GAS from upper respiratory tract

- `IM Procaine Pencillin 400,000 units BD x 10 days` or
- `Oral Penicillin V 250 mg QID x 10 days` or
- `Erythromycin 250 mg QID x 10 days` (for Penicillin hypersensitivity)

After this, long term secondary prevention should be started

## Prevention

- Rheumatic fever occurs following Streptococcal infection of the throat
- Recurrent of rheumatic fever can damage heart
- Patient with rheumatic fever disease needs prevention from infective endocarditis and further damage

### Primary Prevention

- General
  - Avoid the over-crowded areas
  - Have good nutrition
- Antibiotic treatment of GAS, URTI to prevent initial attack
- Acute rheumatic fever
  - `IM Procaine Penicillin 0.5 L Unit/kg BD for 10 days` or
  - `Oral Penicillin V 250 mg QID for 10 days` or
  - `Oral Erythromycin 40 mg/kg/day 3 divided dose for 10 days` (for Penicillin hypersensitivity)

### Secondary Prevention

- Long term antibiotic prophylaxis `to prevent recurrences`
- Prevent colonization of URT with GAS, in those who have had an attack of acute rheumatic fever
  - `IM Benzathine Penicillin 1.2 Mega Units once per month` (< 2 years - 0.6 MU) or
  - `Oral Penicillin V 250 mg BD` or
  - `Oral Sulphadiazine 500 mg BD` or
  - `Oral Erythromycin 250 mg BD` (for Penicillin or Sulphur hypersensitivity)

| ARF with carditis and residual valvular disease (clinical/echo)     | Life long prophylaxis                          |

### Tertiary Prevention

> Prevention of infective endocarditis

- **Tooth extraction**: `Amoxycillin 50 mg/kg` 1 hour before, `25 mg/kg` 6 hours after 1st dose
- **Genitourinary procedures**:
  - Injection `Ampicillin 50 mg/kg` 1/2 hour before precedure, then 8 hours later
  - Injection `Gentamycin 2 mg/kg` 1/2 hour before procedure, then 8 hours later
