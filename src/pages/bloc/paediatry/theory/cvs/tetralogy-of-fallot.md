# Tetralogy of Fallot

> **Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)** : A hole between the right and left ventricles

> **Overriding Aorta**: The aorta is positioned directly over the VSD, receiving blood from both the right and left ventricles

> **Pulmonary Stenosis**: Narrowing of the pulmonary valve and outflow tract

> **Right Ventricular Hypertrophy**: Thickening of the right ventricular muscle due to increased workload from pumping blood through the narrow pulmonary valve

## Pathophysiology

### Right-to-left Shunt

> Blood bypasses the lungs and moves directly from the right side of the heart to the left side, or from the pulmonary circulation to the systemic circulation. This results in deoxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation, causing hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels)

- Right to left shunt through the VSD due to higher resistance caused by pulmonary stenosis → Mixed oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are pumped into systemic circulation → `Low oxygen signs and symptoms`

## Clinical Features

### Cyanosis

- Bluish discoloration of the lips, mouth and nail beds (due to low oxygen)
- Occur later in the 1st year of life

### Paroxysmal Hypercyanotic Attacks / Blue Spells

- Crying, dyspnoeic, restless, worse cyanosis, convulsion and loss of consciousness (severe cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting)
- Occur during the first two years of life
- Occur after waking up or exertion

### Dyspnoea

- Shortness of breath
- Occur on exertion
- Young children play for a short time and then sit or lie down
- Older children rest in a squatting position for the relief of dyspnoea

### Clubbing

- Bulbous swelling of the fingers and toes (due to chronic hypoxia)

## Examination

1. `Growth retardation` (due to chronic hypoxia and inadequate nutrition)
1. `Central cyanosis`
1. `Clubbing`
1. Older children may have `dusky blue skin`, `gray sclerae with engorged blood`
1. Pulse and arterial pulse pressure usually normal
1. Left hemithorax may bulge anteriorly (due to right ventricular hypertrophy)
1. Heart size is generally normal
1. Left parasternal heave
1. `Systolic thrill` along the left sternal border in the thrid and fourth parasternal spaces (about 50%)
1. `Ejection systolic murmur` is most intense at the upper sternal border (2nd left intercostal space)
1. Second heart sound is single or the pulmonary component is soft

## Investigations

### CXR

- Oligaemic lung field (reduced pulmonary blood flow)
- Heart size normal
- Boot shape (concavity at the pulmonary conus and rounded titled apex)

![TOF X-rays](/cvs/tof-x-ray.jpeg)

### ECG

- Right axis deviation
- Right ventricular hypertrophy

### Echocardiogram

- Establish the diagnosis
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Over-riding aorta

### Cardiac catherization

- Morphological defect
- Systolic Pressure in right ventricle almost equal to left ventricular pressure
- Pulmonary artery pressure is markedly reduced
- Oxygen saturation depends on right to left shunt

## Treatment

### Medical Treatment

#### Hypercyanotic spells

One or more of the following in sequence

- Calming and placement of infant on the abdomen in knee-chest position
- 100% oxygen (mask)
- IV Propranolol 0.1-0.2 mg/kg and then prophylactic dose 0.5-1 mg/kg 2-3 times a day orally [^1]
- SC morphine 0.1 mg/kg (not more than 0.2 mg/kg) [^2]
- IV Sodium bicarbonate (in unusually severe spell) [^3]
- Vasopressors - IV phenyl-ephrine/methoxamine [^4] (If resistant to above therapy)

[^1]: To decrease heart rate and myocardial oxygen demands → Decrease workload of the heart
[^2]: To reduce pulmonary effort
[^3]: Hypoxia → Accumulation of lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis (They worsen the cyanosis) ← Corrected with Sodium Bicarbonate
[^4]: Pheynylephrine and Methoxamine are alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonists → Increase systemic vascular resistance through vascoconstriction

#### General

- Maintenance of nutrition
- Prevention and treatment of infective endocarditis
- Prevention and treatment of dehydration
  - Adequate hydration
  - Monitoring and maintenance of hematocrit around 60%

#### Extreme polycythemia and symptomatic patients

- Venesection and volume replacement with albumin or saline transfusion

### Surgical Treatment

#### Palliative

Systemic to pulmonary artery shunt

- Blalock-Taussig shunt (modified): Between subclavian artery and pulmonary artery (most commonly used)
- Waterson shunt: Between ascending aorta and right pulmonary artery
- Potts: Between descending aorta and left pulmonary artery

#### Curative

Corrective open heart surgery and repair

- Relieve right ventricular outflow obstruction and closure of VSD

## Complications

1. Cerebral thrombosis and embolization
1. Brain abscess (Less common)
1. Infective endocarditis
1. Hypercyanotic attacks
1. Growth retardation
1. Iron deficiency anaemia

## Propranolol

> A non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker used for various cardiovascular conditions

### Mechanism of Action

1. Blocks beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors.
1. Reduces heart rate (`negative chronotropic effect`).
1. Decreases myocardial contractility (`negative inotropic effect`).
1. Lowers blood pressure by reducing cardiac output and inhibiting renin release.

### Usage of Propranolol in TOF

> To manage `tet spells` or `hypercyanotic episodes`.

1. Reduces heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption, decreasing the risk of hypercyanotic episodes.
1. Stabilizes infundibular spasm of the RVOT (Right Ventricular Outflow Tract), improving pulmonary blood flow.
1. Reduces the `workload on the heart`, minimizing the oxygen demand and myocardial irritability.

## Metabolic Demand of The Heart

> The amount of energy and oxygen the heart muscle (myocardium) requires to function effectively

1. **Heart Rate (Chronotropy)**: Higher heart rates → Higher metabolic demand (the myocardium requires more energy and oxygen to sustain frequent contraction)
1. **Myocardial Contractility (Inotropy)**: Increased contractility → Increase the metabolic demand (the myocardium works harder and requires more energy to generate stronger contractions)
1. **Wall Stress**: The tension within the myocardial walls during contraction and relaxation.

Wall stress is influenced by:

1. **Preload**: The volume of blood returning to the heart (end-diastolic volume). Higher preload stretches the myocardium, increasing the energy needed for contraction.
1. **Afterload**: The resistance the heart must overcome to eject blood (systemic vascular resistance). Higher afterload requires the heart to generate more force, increasing metabolic demand.
1. **Myocardial Hypertrophy**: Thicker heart walls can increase wall stress and thus the metabolic demand.

### Overall Cardiac Workload

> The combined effect of heart rate, contractility, preload, and afterload.

Greater cardiac workload → Higher metabolic demands
