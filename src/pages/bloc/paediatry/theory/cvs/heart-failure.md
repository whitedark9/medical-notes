# Heart Failure

> List causes of heart failure in children. Discuss management of heart failure caused by rheumatic carditis. (UM1)

## Definition

> The heart cannot pump sufficient blood to meet the metabolic demands of the body.

1. Systolic Heart Failure (HFrEF - Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction)
1. Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF - Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction)
1. Left-Sided Heart Failure
1. Right-Sided Heart Failure
1. Biventricular Heart Failure

## Causes

1. **Con**genital heart diseases
1. **Com**plication of pneumonia
1. Acute **rheu**matic carditis
1. Established **rheu**matic heart diseases
1. **Beri beri**
1. Acute **hyper**tension due to acute glomerulonephritis
1. Supraventricular **tachy**cardia (SVT)
1. Viral **my**ocarditis

1. Severe **anae**mia

## Pathophysiology

> Preload is the initial stretching of the cardiac myocytes prior to contraction, related to end-diastolic volume

- Heart failure → Fluid retention and venous congestion → `Increase preload` → To enhance cardiac output

> Afterload is the resistance the left ventricle must overcome to circulate blood.

- Systemic vascular resistance (e.g. hypertension) and aortic stenosis → `Increase afterload` → Impaired ventricular ejection → Increase myocardial workload

### Neurohormonal Activation

- Increase Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity → Increase heart rate, myocardial contractility and vasoconstriction → `Increase afterload`, myocardial oxygen demand
- Decrease cardiac output → Stimulate `Renin` release → Production of `Angiotensin II` and `Aldosterone`
- Angiotensin II → Vasoconstriction, Sodium and water retention, Myocardial fibrosis
- Aldosterone → Sodium and water retention, Potassium loss, Fibrosis
- Sodium and water retention → `Increase preload`
- Vasoconstriction → `Increase afterload`
- Fibrosis → `Ventricular remodeling`
- Potassium loss → `Electrolyte imbalance`

### Haemodynamic Changes

- `Increase preload` to enhance cardiac output → Excessive preload → Pulmonary congestion and edema
- Impaired myocardial contractiliy or relaxation → Reduce stroke volume → Decrease cardiac output → Inadequate perfusion of tissues and organs → `Compensatory mechanisms`

### Ventricular Remodeling

- Chronic `pressure overload` (e.g. hypertension) or `volume overload` (e.e.g valvular regurgitation) → Adaptive `myocardial hypertrophy` → To maintain cardiac output
- Prolong hypertrophy → Reduce compliance, `Ischemia`, `Arrhythmias`
- Chronic `volume overload` → Ventricular `chamber dilation` → Increase wall stress, Decease contractility

### Apotosis

- If ischemia → Cardiac myocytes undergo programmed cell death (`apotosis`) → Worsen heart failure

## Clinical Features

### In Infants

#### Symptoms

- Breathlessness and excessive perspiration while sucking the nipple of the breast
- Feeding difficulties
- Irritability, Poor weight gain
- Persistant cough and wheezing (Cardiac asthma) [^1]

[^1]: **Cardiac Asthma**: Ventricular dysfunction → Accumulation of fluid in the lungs (Pulmonary congestion) → Bronchial edema → Cough and Wheezing (Cardiac asthma)

#### Signs

- Tachypnoea, Sweating
- Prolonged tachycardia (> 160/min)
- Cardiomegaly (invariable)
- Failure to thrive (Growth retardation)
- Hepatomegaly [^2]
- Oedema - Generalized: usually eyelids and sacrum, less often legs and feet

[^2]: **Hepatomegaly**: Right-sided heart failure → Blood backs up into the systemic venous circulation → Increase venous pressure of hepatic veins → Liver congested with blood → Hepatomegaly

### In Older Children

#### Symptoms [#OC]

- Fatigue
- Effort intolerance, Dyspnoea on excertion
- Orthopnoea [^3]
- Anorexia
- Abdominal pain
- Cough

[^3]: **Orthopnoea**: Dyspnoea that occurs when lying flat, causing the person to sit in a chair or sleep propped up in bed

#### Signs [#OC]

- Tachypnoea
- Tachycardia
- Cardiomegaly (invariable)
- Raised JVP [^4]
- Triple rhythm (Gallop Rhythm) [^5]
- Bilateral basal crepitation [^6]
- Tender enlarge liver [^7]
- Dependent oedema [^8] or anasarca [^9] may be present

[^4]: **Raised JVP**: Right ventricle fails to pump blood → Blood backs up into right atrium and systemic venous circulation → Increase pressure in right atrium → Raised JVP
[^5]: **Triple rhythm**: Hearing added sounds, (1) Ventricular Gallop - S3: Early diastole, (2) Atrial Gallop - S4: At the end of diastole
[^6]: **Basal crepitation**: Crackling or rattling sounds (the sound of hair being rubbed between fingers) heard in the lower parts of the lungs
[^7]: **Tender enlarge liver vs Hepatomegaly**: Both are the enlargement of the liver, but tender enlarge liver has tenderness and pain
[^8]: **Dependent oedema**: Edema that are lower than the heart, typically affected by gravity
[^9]: **Anasarca**: Severe, generalized edema characterized by widespread swelling of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and sometimes body cavity

## Investigations

1. CXR
   - Cardiomegaly
   - Fluffy perihilar pulmonary markings
1. ECG
   - Rhythm abnormalities
   - Chamber hypertrophy
   - Low voltage
1. Biochemical tests
   - Urea and electrolytes
   - Creatine
1. Investigations for underlying cardica lesions (e.g. Echocardiogram)

## Treatment

### General

- Bed rest
- Oxygen
- Diet
- Fluid and electrolytes
- Relieved fever if temperature > 38°C

### Drugs

- `Oral Digoxin 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/day` (1/2 stat, 1/4 and 1/4 at 6-8 hours interval) Maintenace 1/4 - 1/3 of total digitalizing dose OD - BD
- **Diuretics**: `IV Frusemide 1 mg/kg/dose` or `Oral 2-3 mg/kg/day`
- **Vasodilators**: e.g. **ACE inhibitors**: `Enalapril 0.1 mg/kg OD-BD`, `Oral Captopril 0.05-0.1 mg/kg BD-TDS`
- Others: **Inotropes** (e.g. `Dopamine`, `Dobutamine`)

## Treatment of Underlying Cause

### Surgery

- Valve replacement
- Valvoplasty
- Heart transplant (Lesion cannot be repaired by surgery and end stage cardiomyopathy)
