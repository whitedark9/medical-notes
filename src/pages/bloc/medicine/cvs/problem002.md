# Infective Endocarditis

> 25 year old woman came in with low grade fever for a week and feeling loss of energy. On examination, she has temperature of 100\*F, looks pale and slightly dyspneic, BP 100/80 mmHg, heart rate 100/min irregularly irregular and pansystolic murmur. What is happening with her and how would you proceed, give your management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 25-year-old woman
- **Symptoms:**
  - Low-grade fever for a week
  - Loss of energy
- **Examination Findings:**
  - Temperature: 100Â°F
  - Pale appearance
  - Slightly dyspneic
  - Blood pressure: 100/80 mmHg
  - Heart rate: 100/min, irregularly irregular
  - Pansystolic murmur

## Likely Diagnosis

The combination of fever, irregularly irregular heart rate, pansystolic murmur, and dyspnea suggests the possibility of `infective endocarditis (IE)`.

## Differential Diagnoses

- **Infective Endocarditis (IE):** The irregularly irregular heart rate may suggest atrial fibrillation, and the pansystolic murmur could be indicative of valvular involvement (e.g., mitral regurgitation).
- **Anemia:** Pallor and low energy may suggest anemia, which can coexist with or be secondary to chronic infection or other systemic illnesses.
- **Other cardiac conditions:** Such as rheumatic heart disease or congenital heart defects.
- **Non-cardiac conditions:** Such as chronic infections, connective tissue disorders, or malignancies.

## Immediate Management Plan

### Investigations

1. **Blood Tests:**

   - Complete Blood Count (CBC): To check for anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytopenia.
   - Blood Cultures: At least three sets before starting antibiotics to identify causative organism.
   - Inflammatory Markers: ESR, CRP.
   - Renal and Liver Function Tests: To assess end-organ damage.

2. **Imaging:**

   - Echocardiography (preferably Transesophageal Echocardiography - TEE): To assess for vegetations, valvular dysfunction, and complications like abscesses.

3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
   - To confirm atrial fibrillation and rule out other arrhythmias.

### Empirical Treatment

- **Antibiotics:** Start broad-spectrum antibiotics after drawing blood cultures. Common regimens include:
  - `Vancomycin` and `Gentamicin`
  - Adjust based on culture results and sensitivity.

### Supportive Care

- **Antipyretics:** For fever management (e.g., acetaminophen).
- **IV Fluids:** To maintain blood pressure and hydration.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** If dyspnea is significant.

### Monitoring

- **Vital Signs:** Regular monitoring of BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- **Clinical Response:** Monitor for improvement or worsening of symptoms.

## Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Definitive Antibiotic Therapy:** Based on blood culture results, may need prolonged IV antibiotics (4-6 weeks).
2. **Cardiac Monitoring:** Repeated echocardiography to monitor response to treatment and check for complications.
3. **Consultations:**
   - Infectious Disease Specialist: For management of antibiotic therapy.
   - Cardiologist: For management of valvular disease and arrhythmias.
4. **Patient Education:** On the importance of completing the antibiotic course and signs of complications to watch for.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has infective endocarditis, given her presentation.
- Immediate steps include obtaining blood cultures, starting empirical antibiotics, and performing an echocardiogram to assess the extent of cardiac involvement.
- Monitoring and supportive care are essential, followed by long-term management based on culture results and clinical response.
