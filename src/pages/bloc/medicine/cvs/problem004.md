# Rheumatic Heart Disease with Dyspnoea, Orthopnoea, Blood Stained Sputum

> A 55 year old lady with rheumatic heart disease was admitted with acute dyspnoea, orthopnoea and cough with frothy blood stained sputum. How would you manage her?

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 55-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Rheumatic heart disease
  - Acute dyspnea
  - Orthopnea
  - Cough with frothy blood-stained sputum

## Likely Diagnosis

The presentation suggests acute pulmonary edema, likely secondary to decompensated heart failure due to rheumatic heart disease. Mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, common complications of rheumatic heart disease, could precipitate this condition.

## Immediate Management Plan

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs:**

   - Blood pressure
   - Heart rate
   - Respiratory rate
   - Oxygen saturation

2. **Physical Examination:**
   - Auscultation for crackles/rales in the lungs
   - Presence of S3 or S4 heart sounds
   - Signs of peripheral edema

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy:**

   - High-flow oxygen via face mask or non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 94%.
   - Consider non-invasive ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

2. **Positioning:**

   - Keep the patient in an upright position to reduce pulmonary congestion.

3. **Diuretics:**

   - IV Furosemide to reduce fluid overload and alleviate pulmonary congestion.

4. **Vasodilators:**

   - IV Nitroglycerin to reduce preload and afterload (if blood pressure allows).

5. **Morphine:**
   - For symptom relief and to reduce anxiety and dyspnea.

### Monitoring

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring:**
  - To detect arrhythmias.
- **Frequent Vital Signs Monitoring:**
  - BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Investigations

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

2. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To assess the extent of pulmonary edema and rule out other causes.

3. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To evaluate the severity of valvular disease and assess left ventricular function.

4. **Blood Tests:**
   - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - Basic Metabolic Panel
   - B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP)
   - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

### Advanced Management

1. **Cardiology Consultation:**

   - For further management and potential intervention (e.g., valvuloplasty or valve replacement if indicated).

2. **Definitive Treatment:**

   - Management of the underlying rheumatic heart disease:
     - Consideration of surgical or percutaneous intervention for mitral stenosis or regurgitation.
     - Long-term anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation is present.
     - Management of heart failure with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics as needed.

3. **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:**
   - For rheumatic fever prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of rheumatic heart disease.

### Patient Education and Follow-up

1. **Education:**

   - Importance of medication adherence.
   - Recognizing early signs of heart failure exacerbation.
   - Lifestyle modifications (diet, fluid restriction, avoiding excessive salt intake).

2. **Follow-up:**
   - Regular follow-up with a cardiologist.
   - Monitoring of cardiac function and management of comorbid conditions.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has acute pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure from rheumatic heart disease.
- Immediate management involves stabilizing the patient with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators, while monitoring vital signs closely.
- Further investigations and specialist consultations are essential for definitive management of the underlying valvular pathology and long-term care.
