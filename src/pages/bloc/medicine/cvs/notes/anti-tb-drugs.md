# First Line Anti-TB Drugs

> First-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs are the primary medications used in the initial treatment of TB.

They are preferred due to

1. their high efficacy
2. lower toxicity and
3. cost-effectiveness.

## Key First-Line Anti-TB Drugs

### 1. `Isoniazid` (INH)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity (**H** to _Hepatotoxicity_)
  - Peripheral neuropathy (prevented with `pyridoxine, vitamin B6`)
  - Rarely, lupus-like syndrome [^1]
- **Contraindications**: Acute liver disease, Hypersensitivity to `Isoniazid`

[^1]: **Lupus-like syndrome**: Condition that mimic **`Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)`** characterized by similar clinical features: `Arthralgia` (joint pain), `Myalgia` (muscle pain), `Fever`, `Serositis` (inflammation of serous membranes, e.g., pleuritis, pericarditis), `Malar rash` (butterfly-shaped rash on the face), `Photosensitivity`, `Fatigue`

### 2. `Rifampicin` (RIF)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, blocking RNA synthesis.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Orange-red discoloration of bodily fluids (**R** to _Red discoloration_)
  - Gastrointestinal disturbances
  - Drug interactions (induces cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- **Contraindications**: Severe liver disease, concurrent use of drugs metabolized by CYP450 that cannot be adjusted.

### 3. `Pyrazinamide` (PZA)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Disrupts mycobacterial cell membrane metabolism and transport functions.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Hyperuricemia, leading to gout
  - Arthralgia
- **Contraindications**: Severe liver disease, acute gout.

### 4. `Ethambutol` (EMB)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits arabinosyl transferases involved in cell wall synthesis.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Optic neuritis [^2] (dose-dependent, reversible with discontinuation) (**E** to _Eye (Optic)_)
  - Hyperuricemia
- **Contraindications**: Pre-existing optic neuritis, inability to monitor visual acuity.

[^2]: **Optic neuritis**: Optic nerve inflammation

### 5. `Streptomycin` (SM) (less commonly used now)

> Reserved for cases where the primary four-drug regimen cannot be used, or for drug-resistant TB.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial ribosome.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Ototoxicity (hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction)
  - Nephrotoxicity
  - Neuromuscular blockade
- **Contraindications**: Pregnancy, pre-existing renal or auditory impairment.

## Standard Treatment Regimen

### Initial Phase (2 months)

- **Combination Therapy**: `Isoniazid`, `Rifampicin`, `Pyrazinamide`, `Ethambutol` (HRZE).

### Continuation Phase (4 months)

- **Combination Therapy**: `Isoniazid` and `Rifampicin` (HR).

## Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Clinical Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups to assess treatment response and adherence.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Baseline and periodic liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests, and monitoring for hyperuricemia.
- **Visual Acuity**: Baseline and periodic assessment for patients on `Ethambutol`.

## Resistance and Adjustments

- **Drug Resistance**: Emergence of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) necessitates alternative regimens with second-line drugs.
- **Adverse Reactions**: Management involves dose adjustment, drug discontinuation, or substitution as needed.
