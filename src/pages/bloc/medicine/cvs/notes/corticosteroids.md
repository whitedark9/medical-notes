# Corticosteroids

> Corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex or synthesized for medical use. They have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties.

## Mechanism of Action

- **Anti-inflammatory Effects**: Corticosteroids inhibit phospholipase A2, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
- **Immunosuppressive Effects**: They suppress the activation and proliferation of T-cells and reduce the production of cytokines.
- **Metabolic Effects**: Affect carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism, increasing gluconeogenesis, and causing protein catabolism and fat redistribution.

## Types of Corticosteroids

### Glucocorticoids

- **Examples**: Prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone.
- **Primary Actions**: Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive.

### Mineralocorticoids

- **Examples**: Fludrocortisone.
- **Primary Actions**: Regulation of sodium and water balance.

## Indications

### Anti-Inflammatory and Immunosuppressive Uses

- **Autoimmune Diseases**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
- **Allergic Reactions**: Severe asthma, allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis.
- **Dermatologic Conditions**: Eczema, psoriasis.
- **Respiratory Conditions**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- **Transplantation**: Prevention and treatment of organ rejection.
- **Hematologic Conditions**: Immune thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia.
- **Cancer**: Part of chemotherapy regimens for certain cancers (e.g., lymphomas, leukemias).

### Replacement Therapy

- **Adrenal Insufficiency**: Addisonâ€™s disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
- **Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency**: Resulting from pituitary or hypothalamic disorders.

## Side Effects

### Short-Term Use

- **Hyperglycemia**
- **Increased Appetite and Weight Gain**
- **Fluid Retention and Hypertension**
- **Mood Changes**: Euphoria, insomnia, mood swings.
- **Gastrointestinal Upset**: Nausea, peptic ulcer disease.

### Long-Term Use

- **Cushingoid Appearance**: Moon face, buffalo hump, central obesity.
- **Osteoporosis**
- **Muscle Wasting and Weakness**
- **Immunosuppression**: Increased risk of infections.
- **Skin Changes**: Thinning, bruising, striae.
- **Growth Suppression**: In children.
- **Adrenal Suppression**: Suppression of endogenous cortisol production, risk of adrenal crisis upon abrupt withdrawal.
- **Psychiatric Effects**: Depression, psychosis.

## Contraindications and Cautions

- **Infections**: Active, untreated infections.
- **Diabetes Mellitus**: Can exacerbate hyperglycemia.
- **Hypertension**: May worsen blood pressure control.
- **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Osteoporosis**: Increased risk of fractures.
- **Psychiatric Disorders**: May exacerbate pre-existing conditions.
- **Glaucoma and Cataracts**: Can worsen these conditions.
- **Pregnancy**: Use with caution, as some corticosteroids can affect fetal development.

## Dosing and Administration

- **Routes of Administration**: Oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, inhaled, topical.
- **Tapering**: Gradual dose reduction is necessary to prevent adrenal insufficiency after prolonged use.

### Example Regimens

- **Oral Prednisone**: Starting doses typically range from 5 to 60 mg daily, depending on the condition being treated.
- **IV Hydrocortisone**: Used in acute adrenal crisis or severe allergic reactions, typically 100-500 mg every 6-8 hours.
- **Inhaled Corticosteroids**: Used for asthma and COPD, such as fluticasone, budesonide.
