# Heat Stroke

> Heat stroke is a ~~life-threatening condition~~ characterized by a body temperature of 40°C (104°F) or higher, along with central nervous system dysfunction. It is a ~~medical emergency~~ requiring immediate intervention.

## Types of Heat Stroke

### 1. Classic (Non-Exertional) Heat Stroke

- **Population**: Typically affects the elderly, chronically ill, or very young during heatwaves.
- **Mechanism**: Impaired thermoregulation and inability to escape high temperatures.

### 2. Exertional Heat Stroke

- **Population**: Usually affects young, healthy individuals engaged in strenuous physical activity in hot environments.
- **Mechanism**: Excessive heat production overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate heat.

## Pathophysiology

- **Thermoregulatory Failure**: The body’s mechanisms to dissipate heat (sweating, vasodilation) are overwhelmed or fail.
- **Cytokine Release**: Heat stress leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines, contributing to systemic inflammation.
- **Cellular Damage**: Direct heat injury to cells and tissues, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.

## Clinical Features

### Central Nervous System Dysfunction

- **Altered Mental Status**: Confusion, agitation, delirium, seizures, coma.
- **Neurological Deficits**: Ataxia, abnormal posturing.

### Hyperthermia

- **Core Body Temperature**: Typically above 40°C (104°F).

### Skin

- **Classic Heat Stroke**: Hot, dry skin (impaired sweating).
- **Exertional Heat Stroke**: May be sweaty.

### Cardiovascular

- **Tachycardia**
- **Hypotension**: Due to dehydration and vasodilation.

### Respiratory

- **Tachypnea**

### Renal

- **Oliguria**: Due to dehydration and renal injury.

### Gastrointestinal

- **Nausea and Vomiting**
- **Diarrhea**

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Presentation**: High body temperature and CNS dysfunction.
- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: Leukocytosis.
  - **Electrolytes**: Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia.
  - **Renal Function**: Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).
  - **Liver Function**: Elevated liver enzymes.
  - **Coagulation Profile**: Elevated PT/INR, D-dimer.
  - **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: Metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis.
  - **Creatine Kinase (CK)**: Elevated in exertional heat stroke indicating rhabdomyolysis.

## Treatment

> **HEAT**: _**T**emperature Control_, _**A**irway_, _**E**lectrolyte_, _**H**ydration_

### Immediate Cooling

- **Rapid Cooling**: Priority to lower core temperature to below 39°C (102.2°F).
  - **Ice Water Immersion**: Most effective method.
  - **Evaporative Cooling**: Spraying water and using fans.
  - **Ice Packs**: Placed in the groin, axillae, and neck.
- **Monitoring Temperature**: Continuous monitoring of core temperature.

### Supportive Care

- **Airway Management**: Ensure patent airway and support breathing as needed.
- **Electrolyte Management**: Correct imbalances.
- **Hydration**: Intravenous fluids (normal saline or Ringer’s lactate).
- **Monitoring and Management of Complications**:
  - **Renal Failure**: Monitor urine output, consider dialysis if needed.
  - **Rhabdomyolysis**: Aggressive hydration, monitor CK levels.
  - **Coagulopathy**: Fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate if indicated.
- **Medications**: Avoid antipyretics (ineffective and potentially harmful).

### Prevention

- **Education**: Awareness about the risks of heat stroke and preventive measures.
- **Hydration**: Adequate fluid intake before and during exposure to heat.
- **Acclimatization**: Gradual exposure to heat for individuals at risk.
- **Environmental Control**: Access to cool environments and avoiding strenuous activity during peak heat.

## Prognosis

- **Early Intervention**: Critical to reducing mortality and morbidity.
- **Complications**: Can include multi-organ failure, permanent neurological damage, and ~~death~~ if not promptly treated.
