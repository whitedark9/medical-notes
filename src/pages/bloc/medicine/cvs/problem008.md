# Stable Angina Pectoris: Clinical Manifestations and Management

## Clinical Manifestations

### Symptoms

- **Chest Pain/Discomfort:**
  - Typically described as pressure, heaviness, tightness, or squeezing.
  - Location: Often retrosternal, may radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, or back.
  - Duration: Usually lasts from 1 to 15 minutes.
  - Triggered by: Physical exertion, emotional stress, cold weather, or heavy meals.
  - Relieved by: Rest or sublingual nitroglycerin within a few minutes.

### Associated Symptoms

- **Dyspnea:** Shortness of breath during episodes of angina.
- **Nausea:** May accompany severe chest discomfort.
- **Diaphoresis:** Sweating during an angina episode.
- **Fatigue:** Generalized fatigue and weakness, especially in women.

### Physical Examination

- **Often Normal:** Most patients with stable angina have no abnormal findings on physical examination.
- **Signs of Atherosclerosis:** May be present, such as bruits or diminished pulses.

### Diagnostic Tests

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

  - Usually normal at rest.
  - May show ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion during an episode of angina.

- **Stress Testing:**

  - Exercise ECG or pharmacologic stress test to provoke symptoms and detect ischemic changes.
  - Stress echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging can provide additional information.

- **Coronary Angiography:**

  - Definitive test to visualize coronary artery stenosis if non-invasive tests are inconclusive or if revascularization is considered.

- **Laboratory Tests:**
  - Lipid profile, fasting glucose, HbA1c to assess cardiovascular risk factors.

## Management

### Lifestyle Modifications

- **Smoking Cessation:** Essential to reduce cardiovascular risk.
- **Diet:** Low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol; high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
- **Exercise:** Regular physical activity, tailored to individual capability and cardiovascular status.
- **Weight Management:** Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.

### Pharmacologic Treatment

1. **Anti-Anginal Medications:**

   - **Nitrates:**
     - **Short-acting:** Sublingual nitroglycerin for acute relief.
     - **Long-acting:** Isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate for chronic prophylaxis.
   - **Beta-Blockers:**
     - Reduce heart rate, myocardial contractility, and oxygen demand (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol).
   - **Calcium Channel Blockers:**
     - Reduce myocardial oxygen demand and increase coronary blood flow (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem).

2. **Antiplatelet Agents:**

   - **Aspirin:**
     - Low-dose aspirin (75-162 mg daily) to reduce the risk of thrombotic events.
   - **P2Y12 Inhibitors:**
     - Clopidogrel in patients who are intolerant to aspirin.

3. **Statins:**

   - To lower LDL cholesterol and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques (e.g., atorvastatin, rosuvastatin).

4. **ACE Inhibitors/ARBs:**
   - Recommended for patients with hypertension, diabetes, or left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., lisinopril, losartan).

### Revascularization

1. **Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):**

   - Angioplasty with stent placement for significant coronary artery stenosis causing symptoms despite optimal medical therapy.

2. **Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):**
   - Surgical revascularization for patients with severe, multivessel disease or left main coronary artery disease.

### Monitoring and Follow-up

- **Regular Follow-up Visits:**
  - Monitor symptom control, adherence to treatment, and management of risk factors.
- **Risk Factor Control:**
  - Regular check-ups to manage blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid levels.
- **Patient Education:**
  - Importance of medication adherence, recognizing symptoms of worsening angina, and lifestyle changes.

## Conclusion

- Stable angina pectoris is characterized by predictable chest pain triggered by exertion or stress, relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.
- Management focuses on lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy to reduce symptoms and prevent cardiovascular events, and revascularization for refractory cases.
- Regular follow-up and risk factor control are crucial for optimal long-term outcomes.
