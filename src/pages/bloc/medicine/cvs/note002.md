# Organophosphate Poisoning

> Organophosphate (OP) poisoning is a serious and potentially fatal condition resulting from exposure to organophosphate compounds, which are commonly found in pesticides and nerve agents.

## Mechanism of Action

- **Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)**: Organophosphates inhibit AChE, an enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine (ACh) in synapses.
- **Accumulation of Acetylcholine**: This inhibition leads to an accumulation of ACh in synapses, causing overstimulation of nicotinic [^1] and muscarinic receptors [^2].

[^1]: **Nicotinic receptor**: When Ach binds → Open the ligand-gated channels → Increase Na+ inflex and K+ efflex → Depolarization and Action potential → **Muscle contraction**
[^2]: **Muscarinic receptor**: When Ach binds → Activate G-protein → Activate cAMP and phospholipase C → Change in heart rate, gland secretion, muscle contraction (depend on the site)

## Clinical Features

### Nicotinic Effects

- **Muscle Fasciculations**: Involuntary muscle twitches.
- **Weakness**: Generalized muscle weakness.
- **Paralysis**: Severe cases can lead to respiratory muscle paralysis.

### Muscarinic Effects (DUMB BLESS)

- **D**: Diarrhea
- **U**: Urination
- **M**: Miosis (pupil constriction)
- **B**: Bradycardia
- **B**: Bronchospasm
- **L**: Lacrimation (tearing)
- **E**: Emesis (vomiting)
- **S**: Salivation
- **S**: Sweating

### Central Nervous System Effects

- **Confusion**
- **Agitation**
- **Seizures**
- **Coma**

## Diagnosis

- **History and Clinical Presentation**: Exposure history and characteristic symptoms.
- **Cholinesterase Activity**: Measurement of blood cholinesterase activity (plasma pseudocholinesterase and red blood cell AChE levels) is often reduced in OP poisoning.

## Treatment

### Initial Management

- **Decontamination**: Remove contaminated clothing and wash skin thoroughly with soap and water.
- **Supportive Care**: Ensure airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC).

### Antidotes

- **`Atropine`**: Antimuscarinic agent that blocks the effects of excess acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. Dose is titrated to the clinical effect (e.g., drying of bronchial secretions).
- **`Pralidoxime` (2-PAM)**: Reactivates AChE if given early (within 24-48 hours) by cleaving the organophosphate-enzyme complex, particularly effective for nicotinic symptoms.

### Additional Therapies

- **`Benzodiazepines`**: For seizure control.
- **Mechanical Ventilation**: May be necessary for respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles.

## Contraindications

- **`Succinylcholine`**: Avoid in OP poisoning as it can prolong paralysis due to AChE inhibition.

## Prognosis

- **Early Intervention**: Prompt recognition and treatment improve prognosis.
- **Delayed Treatment**: Can lead to severe complications, including prolonged ventilatory support, neurologic deficits, or ~~death~~.
