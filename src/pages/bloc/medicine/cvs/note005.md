# Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB)

> Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), the two most potent TB drugs.

## Causes and Risk Factors

- **Incomplete or Improper Treatment**: Inadequate drug regimens, poor patient adherence.
- **Transmission**: Direct transmission from individuals with MDR-TB.
- **HIV Co-Infection**: Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible.
- **Previous TB Treatment**: Higher risk in patients with prior TB treatment, especially if it was incomplete or inadequate.

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Evaluation**: Symptoms like chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and hemoptysis.
- **Microbiological Tests**:
  - Sputum smear microscopy.
  - Culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST).
  - Rapid molecular tests (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) to detect rifampicin resistance.
- **Radiological Evaluation**: Chest X-rays or CT scans to assess lung involvement.

## Treatment Regimens

### Conventional MDR-TB Treatment

- **Duration**: Typically 18-24 months.
- **Drugs**: Includes second-line anti-TB drugs such as:
  - **Fluoroquinolones**: Levofloxacin, moxifloxacin.
  - **Injectable Agents**: Amikacin, capreomycin, kanamycin.
  - **Other Agents**: Ethionamide, cycloserine, linezolid, clofazimine, bedaquiline, delamanid.

### Shorter MDR-TB Regimen

- **Duration**: 9-12 months.
- **Components**: Standardized shorter regimen recommended by WHO in selected patients without resistance to fluoroquinolones or second-line injectable drugs.

## Side Effects of MDR-TB Drugs

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Tendonitis, QT prolongation.
- **Injectables**: Ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity.
- **Ethionamide/Prothionamide**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, hypothyroidism.
- **Cycloserine**: Neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizures.
- **Linezolid**: Bone marrow suppression, peripheral neuropathy.
- **Clofazimine**: Skin discoloration, gastrointestinal disturbances.
- **Bedaquiline**: QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity.
- **Delamanid**: QT prolongation.

## Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Monthly Sputum Cultures**: To monitor treatment response.
- **Adverse Effect Monitoring**: Regular assessments for drug toxicity.
- **Adherence Support**: Counseling and support to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen.
- **HIV Testing**: All TB patients should be tested for HIV.

## Preventive Measures

- **Infection Control**: Use of masks, proper ventilation, and isolation of infectious patients.
- **Screening and Prophylaxis**: Regular screening of high-risk populations and prophylactic treatment for latent TB in contacts of MDR-TB patients.
- **Vaccination**: BCG vaccination in endemic areas.

## Prognosis

- **Early Diagnosis and Effective Treatment**: Key to a favorable outcome.
- **Treatment Adherence**: Critical to prevent the development of further drug resistance and achieve cure.
- **Mortality and Morbidity**: Higher in MDR-TB compared to drug-susceptible TB, especially if associated with HIV.
