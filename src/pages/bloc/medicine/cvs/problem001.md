# Severe Retrosternal Chest Pain

> A 45 year old man came in with history of severe retrosternal chest pain for 1 hour duration. He is known to have hypertension and on amlodipine 5 mg once a day for 1 year. On examination, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg on right arm, pulse rate 110/min regular and some features of prostration. What are your differential diagnoses and how would you proceed and give your management plan?

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 45-year-old man
- **History:**
  - Severe retrosternal chest pain for 1 hour duration
  - Known history of hypertension, on amlodipine 5 mg once a day for 1 year
- **Examination Findings:**
  - Blood pressure: 130/90 mmHg (right arm)
  - Pulse rate: 110/min, regular
  - Features of prostration (extreme physical weakness or collapse)

## Differential Diagnoses

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) [^1]:**

   - Severe, sudden onset chest pain
   - Hypertension as a risk factor
   - Prostration suggests significant cardiovascular compromise

[^1]: **AMI**: Plaques formation in coronary arteries → Stress, Inflammation cause plaque rupture → Release of thrombogenic materials into bloodstream → Formation of thrombus by platelets ahesion and aggregation → Increase growth → Partial or total occlusion of coronary artery → Decrease oxygen and blood supply to heart muscle (myocardium) → Ischemia of heart (`Myocardial ischemia`) → If duration is longer, necrosis

2. **Unstable Angina [^2]:**

   - Similar presentation to AMI but without myocardial necrosis
   - Requires immediate attention as it can progress to AMI

[^2]: **Angina**: Similar to AMI without necrosis, only `Myocardial ischemia`

3. **Aortic Dissection [^3]:**

   - Severe, tearing chest pain that can radiate to the back
   - Hypertension is a significant risk factor

[^3]: **Aortic dissection**: Tear in intima layer of aorta → Blood enters the media layer through the tear → Create false lumen → Aortic wall becomes thinner → Risk of rupture (~~Medical Emergency~~)

4. **Pulmonary Embolism [^4]:**

   - Sudden onset of chest pain and possible dyspnea
   - Prostration due to compromised hemodynamics

[^4]: **Pulmonary Embolism**: Thrombus formation (e.g, in `Deep Vein Thrombosis`) → Thrombus breaks loose and travel through the venous system → Reach pulmonary arteries → Occlusion of pulmonary arteries → No perfusion → Hypoxemia → Worsen by bronchoconstriction of inflammatory mediators → `Secondary pulmonary hypertension`; Occlusion of pulmonary arteries → Right ventricular failure → Decrease cardiac output;

5. **Pericarditis [^5]:**
   - Sharp chest pain that may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward
   - Can present with systemic symptoms like prostration

[^5]: **Pericarditis**: Inflammation of pericardial layers → Increase vascular permeability → Accumulation of fluid in pericardial space (`Pericardial effusion`); Inflammation → Deposits of fibrin on the pericardial surfaces → Rough, thickened pericardial surfaces → Sharp chest pain (relieved by leaning forwards and sitting up, worsen by lying down and deep breath)

## Immediate Management Plan

### Investigations

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes, arrhythmias, or signs of pericarditis.

2. **Cardiac Biomarkers:**

   - Troponin I or T, CK-MB to assess for myocardial injury.

3. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To rule out other causes of chest pain like aortic dissection or pneumonia.

4. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To assess cardiac function and rule out structural abnormalities or pericardial effusion.

5. **Blood Tests:**
   - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - Basic Metabolic Panel
   - Coagulation profile

### Immediate Treatment

1. **MONA Protocol for Suspected Myocardial Infarction:**

   - **`Morphine`:** For pain relief if needed.
   - **`Oxygen`:** If oxygen saturation is below 94%.
   - **`Nitroglycerin`:** Sublingual or IV, unless contraindicated.
   - **`Aspirin`:** 325 mg chewable, to inhibit platelet aggregation.

2. **Antithrombotic Therapy:**

   - **`Clopidogrel`:** Loading dose for antiplatelet effect.

3. **Anticoagulation:**
   - **`Heparin`:** IV bolus followed by continuous infusion if AMI is confirmed.

### Monitoring

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring:** To detect arrhythmias.
- **Vital Signs:** Frequent monitoring of BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Advanced Management

1. **Cardiology Consultation:**

   - For further evaluation and management, including possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

2. **Reperfusion Therapy:**

   - **Primary PCI:** Preferred method if available within 90 minutes of first medical contact.
   - **Thrombolysis:** If PCI is not available within the recommended time frame.

3. **Management of Complications:**
   - **Heart Failure:** If present, manage with `diuretics`, `ACE inhibitors`, and other appropriate medications.
   - **Arrhythmias:** Manage according to specific type (e.g., `beta-blockers` for tachyarrhythmias).

## Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Medication Adjustments:**

   - Continue antiplatelet therapy with dual antiplatelet agents (e.g., `aspirin` and `clopidogrel`).
   - Statins for lipid management.
   - Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors if not contraindicated.

2. **Lifestyle Modifications:**

   - Smoking cessation, dietary changes, regular physical activity.

3. **Regular Monitoring:**

   - Follow-up with cardiologist.
   - Regular monitoring of BP, lipid levels, and cardiac function.

4. **Patient Education:**
   - Recognizing symptoms of angina or AMI.
   - Importance of medication adherence and lifestyle changes.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has an acute myocardial infarction, given the presentation of severe retrosternal chest pain, history of hypertension, and signs of cardiovascular compromise.
- Immediate steps include confirming the diagnosis with ECG and cardiac biomarkers, initiating the MONA protocol, and preparing for possible reperfusion therapy.
- Regular monitoring, supportive care, and long-term management with lifestyle modifications and medication adjustments are essential.
