# Severe Retrosternal Chest Pain

> A 45 year old man came in with history of severe retrosternal chest pain for 1 hour duration. He is known to have hypertension and on amlodipine 5 mg once a day for 1 year. On examination, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg on right arm, pulse rate 110/min regular and some features of prostration. What are your differential diagnoses and how would you proceed and give your management plan?

## Differential Diagnoses

1. **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**

   - Symptoms: Severe retrosternal chest pain, prostration, hypertension history.
   - Examination: Elevated pulse rate, blood pressure control.

2. **Unstable Angina**

   - Symptoms: Chest pain, hypertension history.
   - Examination: Regular pulse rate, stable blood pressure.

3. **Aortic Dissection**

   - Symptoms: Sudden severe chest pain, often described as tearing or ripping.
   - Examination: Possible blood pressure differential between arms, prostration.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism**

   - Symptoms: Chest pain, shortness of breath, history of immobility or clotting disorders.
   - Examination: Tachycardia, prostration.

5. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

   - Symptoms: Retrosternal chest pain, history of dietary triggers.
   - Examination: Often normal, pain may improve with antacids.

6. **Pericarditis**
   - Symptoms: Chest pain that may improve when sitting up and leaning forward.
   - Examination: Possible pericardial friction rub.

## Immediate Management Plan

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - **ABC**: Assess Airway, Breathing, Circulation.
   - **Vitals**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
   - **IV Access**: Establish intravenous access.

2. **Investigations**

   - **ECG**: To rule out or confirm acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
   - **Cardiac Enzymes**: Troponin I or T to identify myocardial infarction.
   - **Chest X-ray**: To look for signs of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or other causes.
   - **D-dimer**: If suspicion of pulmonary embolism.
   - **Echocardiogram**: If pericarditis or aortic dissection is suspected.
   - **Blood Tests**: Complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation profile.

3. **Acute Management**

   - **Oxygen Therapy**: If oxygen saturation is below 94%.
   - **Aspirin**: 300 mg to chew, for suspected ACS.
   - **Nitroglycerin**: Sublingual nitroglycerin, unless contraindicated (e.g., suspected aortic dissection).
   - **Pain Management**: Morphine for severe pain if ACS is suspected.
   - **Anticoagulation**: Low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin if ACS or pulmonary embolism is suspected.

4. **Further Management Based on Diagnosis**
   - **Acute Myocardial Infarction**: Consider reperfusion therapy (e.g., thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention).
   - **Unstable Angina**: Continue with antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy, consider beta-blockers and statins.
   - **Aortic Dissection**: Immediate surgical consultation, beta-blockers to control heart rate and blood pressure.
   - **Pulmonary Embolism**: Anticoagulation therapy, thrombolysis in severe cases.
   - **GERD**: Antacids, proton pump inhibitors.
   - **Pericarditis**: NSAIDs, colchicine, consider corticosteroids if not contraindicated.

## Monitoring and Follow-up

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring**: For arrhythmias and ischemic changes.
- **Frequent Reassessment**: Vitals, pain level, response to treatment.
- **Referral to Cardiology**: For further evaluation and management.

## Long-term Management

- **Control Hypertension**: Optimize antihypertensive therapy.
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Dietary changes, smoking cessation, regular exercise.
- **Medication Adherence**: Ensure compliance with prescribed medications.
