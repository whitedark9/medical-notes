# Breathlessness with Bilateral Leg Edema

> 55 year old man, CEO of private company, came in with history of breathlessness on exertion for one week and some slight swelling of both feet. He is known to have hypertension and on Atenolol 50mg once a day for 1 year. On examination, BP is 130/90 mmHg on right arm, pulse rate 110/min regular and some features of breathlessness. What are the differential diagnosis and how would you proceed and give your management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 55-year-old man, CEO of a private company
- **History:**
  - Breathlessness on exertion for one week
  - Slight swelling of both feet
  - Known history of hypertension, on `Atenolol 50mg` once a day for 1 year
- **Examination Findings:**
  - Blood pressure: 130/90 mmHg (right arm)
  - Pulse rate: 110/min, regular
  - Features of breathlessness

## Differential Diagnoses

### 1. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) [^1]

- Breathlessness on exertion
- Bilateral lower extremity edema
- History of hypertension

### 2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

- Breathlessness, though usually accompanied by a history of smoking or respiratory infections

### 3. Pulmonary Embolism

- Acute onset of breathlessness, but swelling of both feet is less common

### 4. Renal Insufficiency

- Can cause fluid retention and lower extremity edema

### 5. Medication Side Effect

- `Atenolol`, though less likely, could potentially contribute to heart failure or exacerbate symptoms

## Immediate Management Plan

### Investigations

1. **Blood Tests:**

   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To rule out anemia or infection.
   - **Basic Metabolic Panel**: To check renal function and electrolytes.
   - **B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP)**: Elevated levels can indicate heart failure.
   - **Liver Function Tests**: To rule out hepatic congestion. (Congestive Heart Failure → Cardiac Cirrhosis)

2. **Imaging:**

   - **Chest X-ray**: To check for pulmonary congestion, cardiomegaly, or other pulmonary causes.
   - **Echocardiogram**: To assess cardiac function, ejection fraction, and rule out valvular disease or structural abnormalities.

3. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To check for arrhythmias, ischemic changes, or other cardiac abnormalities.

4. **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):**
   - If COPD is suspected based on clinical history and examination.

### Initial Treatment

1. **Diuretics:**

   - `Loop diuretics` (e.g., `Furosemide`) to manage fluid overload and reduce edema.

2. **Optimization of Hypertension Management:**

   - Review and potentially adjust antihypertensive medications.
   - Consider adding an `ACE inhibitor or ARB` if not contraindicated.

3. **Beta-blocker Review:**
   - Assess the appropriateness of continuing `Atenolol`; consider switching to a beta-blocker with proven benefits in heart failure (e.g., `Carvedilol`, `Metoprolol succinate`).

### Supportive Care

- **Oxygen Therapy:** If hypoxia is present.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:**
  - Dietary sodium restriction.
  - No alcohol drinking.
  - NO smoking.
  - Fluid restriction if significant fluid overload is present.

### Monitoring

- **Vital Signs:** Regular monitoring of BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- **Weight Monitoring:** Daily weight measurement to monitor fluid status.
- **Clinical Response:** Monitor for improvement or worsening of symptoms.

## Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Cardiology Referral:**

   - For further assessment and management of potential heart failure or other cardiac conditions.

2. **Regular Monitoring:**

   - Follow-up appointments to monitor BP, renal function, and electrolytes.
   - Reassessment of medication regimen as needed.

3. **Patient Education:**
   - Importance of medication adherence.
   - Recognizing symptoms of worsening heart failure.
   - Lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has congestive heart failure given his presentation of breathlessness, bilateral edema, and history of hypertension.
- Immediate steps include confirming the diagnosis with appropriate investigations, initiating diuretic therapy, and optimizing his hypertension management.
- Regular monitoring and supportive care are essential, followed by long-term management and specialist referral as needed.

### Systolic Heart Failure

> Heart cannot pump blood during ventricular contraction (systole)

- **Ischemic Heart Disease** → Coronary Artery occulsion or blockage → Less oxygen to myocardium (heart muscle) → Decrease contraction
- **Long-standing hypertension** → Increase arterial blood pressure → Heart pumps blood harder → Hypertrophy of ventricle → Increase Oxygen demands → Weaker contraction
- **Dilated cardiomyopahy** → Big room of ventricle → Increase preload → Heart pumps blood harder

### Diastolic Heart Failure

> Blood filling defect during ventricular relaxation (diastole)

Blood in ventricle before contraction = Preload

- **Long-standing hypertension** → Hypertropy of ventricle → Less preload (Less room for blood)
- **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**, **Aortic Stenosis** → **Concentric Hypertrophy** → Less preload
- **Restrictive cardiomyopathy** → Heart muscle cannot stretch → Less preload

### Clinical Features

- Heart Failure → Decrease cardiac output (less blood pumping) → Decrease blood to kidneys → Activate Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) → Na+ and water retention → Fluid retention → **Edema**, **Lung congestion**

- Decrease cardiac output → Increase pulmonary pressure due to backward flow → Fluid accumulation in the lung → Decrease O2 and CO2 perfusion → **Dyspnea**, **Orthopnea**, **PND**, **Cracles**
