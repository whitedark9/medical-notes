# Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis with Breathlessness, Cough and Forthy Expectoration

> A 30 year old lady with history of rheumatic mitral stenosis was admitted for acute breathlessness associated with cough and frothy expectoration. Outline the management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 30-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Rheumatic mitral stenosis
  - Acute breathlessness
  - Cough with frothy expectoration

## Likely Diagnosis

The symptoms suggest acute pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure due to rheumatic mitral stenosis.

## Immediate Management Plan

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs:**

   - Blood pressure
   - Heart rate
   - Respiratory rate
   - Oxygen saturation

2. **Physical Examination:**
   - Auscultation for crackles/rales in the lungs
   - Heart sounds for murmurs or additional sounds (S3, S4)
   - Signs of peripheral edema

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy:**

   - High-flow oxygen via face mask or non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 94%.
   - Consider non-invasive ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

2. **Positioning:**

   - Keep the patient in an upright position to reduce pulmonary congestion.

3. **Diuretics:**

   - IV Furosemide to reduce fluid overload and alleviate pulmonary congestion.

4. **Vasodilators:**

   - IV Nitroglycerin to reduce preload and afterload, provided blood pressure is adequate.

5. **Morphine:**
   - For symptom relief, to reduce anxiety and dyspnea.

### Monitoring

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring:**
  - To detect arrhythmias.
- **Frequent Vital Signs Monitoring:**
  - BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Investigations

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

2. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To assess the extent of pulmonary edema and rule out other causes.

3. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To evaluate the severity of mitral stenosis and assess left ventricular function.

4. **Blood Tests:**
   - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - Basic Metabolic Panel
   - B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP)
   - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

### Advanced Management

1. **Cardiology Consultation:**

   - For further management and potential intervention, such as balloon valvuloplasty or valve replacement if indicated.

2. **Definitive Treatment:**

   - Management of underlying mitral stenosis:
     - Consideration of percutaneous or surgical intervention.
     - Long-term anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation is present.
     - Management of heart failure with ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics as needed.

3. **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:**
   - For rheumatic fever prophylaxis to prevent recurrence.

### Patient Education and Follow-up

1. **Education:**

   - Importance of medication adherence.
   - Recognizing early signs of heart failure exacerbation.
   - Lifestyle modifications (diet, fluid restriction, avoiding excessive salt intake).

2. **Follow-up:**
   - Regular follow-up with a cardiologist.
   - Monitoring of cardiac function and management of comorbid conditions.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has acute pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure from rheumatic mitral stenosis.
- Immediate management involves stabilizing the patient with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators, while closely monitoring vital signs.
- Further investigations and specialist consultations are essential for definitive management of the underlying valvular pathology and long-term care.
