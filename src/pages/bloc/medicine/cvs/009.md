# First Line Anti-TB Drugs

First-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs are the primary medications used in the initial treatment of TB. They are preferred due to their high efficacy, lower toxicity, and cost-effectiveness.

## Key First-Line Anti-TB Drugs

### 1. Isoniazid (INH)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall.
- **Usages**: Primary drug for all forms of TB, including latent TB infection (LTBI).
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Peripheral neuropathy (prevented with pyridoxine, vitamin B6)
  - Rarely, lupus-like syndrome
- **Contraindications**: Acute liver disease, history of severe adverse reactions to INH.

### 2. Rifampicin (RIF)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, blocking RNA synthesis.
- **Usages**: Essential component of TB treatment regimens, effective against both active and latent TB.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Orange-red discoloration of bodily fluids
  - Gastrointestinal disturbances
  - Drug interactions (induces cytochrome P450 enzymes)
- **Contraindications**: Severe liver disease, concurrent use of drugs metabolized by CYP450 that cannot be adjusted.

### 3. Pyrazinamide (PZA)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Disrupts mycobacterial cell membrane metabolism and transport functions.
- **Usages**: Shortening TB treatment duration; particularly effective in acidic environments, such as within phagolysosomes.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Hepatotoxicity
  - Hyperuricemia, leading to gout
  - Arthralgia
- **Contraindications**: Severe liver disease, acute gout.

### 4. Ethambutol (EMB)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits arabinosyl transferases involved in cell wall synthesis.
- **Usages**: Included to prevent the emergence of drug resistance; used in initial treatment regimens.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Optic neuritis (dose-dependent, reversible with discontinuation)
  - Hyperuricemia
- **Contraindications**: Pre-existing optic neuritis, inability to monitor visual acuity.

### 5. Streptomycin (SM) (less commonly used now)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial ribosome.
- **Usages**: Reserved for cases where the primary four-drug regimen cannot be used, or for drug-resistant TB.
- **Side Effects**:
  - Ototoxicity (hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction)
  - Nephrotoxicity
  - Neuromuscular blockade
- **Contraindications**: Pregnancy, pre-existing renal or auditory impairment.

## Standard Treatment Regimen

### Initial Phase (2 months)

- **Combination Therapy**: Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol (HRZE).

### Continuation Phase (4 months)

- **Combination Therapy**: Isoniazid and Rifampicin (HR).

## Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Clinical Monitoring**: Regular follow-ups to assess treatment response and adherence.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Baseline and periodic liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests, and monitoring for hyperuricemia.
- **Visual Acuity**: Baseline and periodic assessment for patients on Ethambutol.

## Resistance and Adjustments

- **Drug Resistance**: Emergence of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) necessitates alternative regimens with second-line drugs.
- **Adverse Reactions**: Management involves dose adjustment, drug discontinuation, or substitution as needed.
