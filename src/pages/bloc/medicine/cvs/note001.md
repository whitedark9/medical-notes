# Paracetamol Poisoning

> Paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning is a common cause of drug overdose, which can lead to severe liver damage if not promptly treated.

## Mechanism of Action

- **Therapeutic Use**: Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic drug, commonly used for pain relief and fever reduction.
- **Toxic Metabolite**: In overdose, the liver's normal conjugation pathways (sulfation and glucuronidation) become saturated, leading to increased metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system. This produces N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite.
- **Glutathione Depletion**: Normally, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. In overdose, glutathione stores are depleted, and NAPQI accumulates, causing hepatocellular injury.

## Clinical Features

### Stages of Poisoning

1. **Stage I (0-24 hours)**: Nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, pallor.
2. **Stage II (24-72 hours)**: Right upper quadrant pain, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), and bilirubin levels.
3. **Stage III (72-96 hours)**: Peak hepatotoxicity with jaundice, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure.
4. **Stage IV (4 days to 2 weeks)**: Recovery phase or progression to multi-organ failure and death.

## Diagnosis

- **History and Clinical Presentation**: Timing and amount of ingestion are crucial.
- **Serum Paracetamol Level**: Measurement at least 4 hours post-ingestion to assess risk using the Rumack-Matthew nomogram.
- **Liver Function Tests**: Elevated transaminases (ALT, AST) indicate liver injury.
- **Coagulation Profile**: Elevated INR/PT may indicate severe liver damage.

## Treatment

### Initial Management

- **Activated Charcoal**: Administer within 1-2 hours of ingestion to reduce absorption.

### Antidote

- **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Replenishes glutathione stores and enhances non-toxic metabolism of paracetamol. Effective if given within 8 hours of ingestion.
  - **Oral NAC**: Loading dose of 140 mg/kg, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for 17 doses.
  - **Intravenous NAC**: Loading dose of 150 mg/kg over 1 hour, followed by 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours.

### Supportive Care

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of liver function, coagulation profile, renal function, and electrolytes.
- **Symptomatic Treatment**: Manage nausea, vomiting, and pain.

### Liver Transplantation

- Considered in cases of fulminant hepatic failure with criteria including encephalopathy, coagulopathy, acidosis, and renal failure.

## Prognosis

- **Early Intervention**: Good prognosis if NAC is administered within 8 hours.
- **Delayed Treatment**: Increased risk of severe hepatotoxicity, acute liver failure, and death.
