# Infective Endocarditis

> 25 year old woman came in with low grade fever for a week and feeling loss of energy. On examination, she has temperature of 100°F, looks pale and slightly dyspneic, BP 100/80 mmHg, heart rate 100/min irregularly irregular and pansystolic murmur. What is happening with her and how would you proceed, give your management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient**: 25 year old woman
- **Symptoms**:
  - Low grade fever for a week
  - Loss of energy
- **Examination Findings**:
  - Temperature 100°F
  - Pale appearance
  - Slightly dyspneic
  - Blood pressure 100/80 mmHg
  - Heart rate 100/min, irregularly irregular
  - Pansystolic murmur

## Likely Diagnosis

The presentation suggests `infective endocarditis (IE)` with atrial fibrillation and mitral or tricuspid valve involement.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Low grade fever for a week.
  - Loss of energy and fatigue.
  - Pallor, indicating possible anemia [^1].
  - Slight dyspnea (shortness of breath).
  - Blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg.
  - Heart rate of 100/min, irregularly irregular (suggestive of atrial fibrillation).
  - Pansystolic murmur, which may indicate valve involvement.

[^1]: **Anemia**: (1) Destruction of RBCs by bacterial toxins, (2) Inhibition of erythropoiesis in bone marrow by inflammatory cytokines and glomerunephritis

## Management Plan

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation.
2. **Detailed History and Physical Examination**: Including a history of any recent dental procedures, IV drug use, or predisposing heart conditions.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy**: If oxygen saturation is low.
2. **IV Access**: For administration of medications and fluids.

### Investigation

1. **Blood Cultures**: Three sets of blood cultures from different sites before starting antibiotics.
2. **Echocardiography**: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) preferred over transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for better visualization of vegetations and valve involvement.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for anemia, leukocytosis.
4. **Electrolytes, Renal Function Tests**: To check for electrolyte imbalances and renal involvement.
5. **Urinalysis**: To detect hematuria, proteinuria (suggesting glomerulonephritis).
6. **ECG**: To assess for arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities.
7. **Chest X-ray**: To check for pulmonary emboli or heart failure.

### Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis

1. **Antibiotic Therapy**:
   - Empirical treatment until culture results are available.
   - Common regimens: `Vancomycin + Gentamicin`, or `Ceftriaxone + Gentamicin`.
   - Adjust based on culture results and antibiotic sensitivity.
2. **Management of Atrial Fibrillation**:
   - Rate control with `beta-blockers` (e.g., `metoprolol`) or `calcium channel blockers` (e.g., `diltiazem`).
   - `Anticoagulation` if there are no contraindications, to prevent thromboembolism.
3. **Supportive Care**:
   - Blood transfusion if significant anemia is present.
   - Fluid management to maintain hemodynamic stability.
4. **Consultation with Cardiology**:
   - For potential surgical intervention (e.g., valve repair or replacement, removal of infective material) if there is severe valvular dysfunction, heart failure, or persistent infection despite antibiotics.

### Monitoring and Reassessment

1. **Frequent Monitoring**: Vital signs, response to treatment.
2. **Repeat Blood Cultures**: To ensure clearance of bacteremia.
3. **Regular Assessment**: Of heart failure symptoms, signs of embolic events, and other complications.

### Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Prolonged Antibiotic Course**: Typically 4-6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
2. **Regular Follow-up**: With cardiology and infectious disease specialists.
3. **Patient Education**: On the importance of completing the antibiotic course, monitoring for symptoms of recurrence, and maintaining good dental hygiene to prevent future episodes.
4. **Prophylactic Antibiotics**: For high-risk procedures if recommended by guidelines.

## Infective Endocarditis (IE)

> An infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, typically involving the heart valves.

### Common organisms

1. _Streptococcus viridans_
1. _Staphylococcus aureus_
1. _Enterococci_
1. _HACEK group_
   1. _Haemophilus_ species: _Haemophilus aphrophilus_, _Haemophilus parainfluenzae_
   2. _Aggregatibacter_ species (formerly Actinobacillus): _Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans_, _Aggregatibacter aphrophilus_
   3. _Cardiobacterium_ hominis
   4. _Eikenella corrodens_
   5. _Kingella_ species: _Kingella kingae_

### Pathophysiology

#### Endothelial Damage

- **Damage to endothelium of heart valves or endocardium of heart** → Exposure of underlying layers → Platelet adhesion and fibrin deposition at the site of injury → Formation of sterile (non-bacterial) thrombotic vegetation → A place for bacterial colonization → Bacteria causes more growth of vegetation → Dense layer of fibrin and platelet protects the bacteria from host immune system and antibiotic penetration → Inflammation of the heart valve

#### Heart

- Damage to heart valves → Acute or chronic valvular insufficiency → `Heart failure`
- (1) Vegetation growth, (2) Valve damage, (3) Embolization, (4) New valve involvement → `Changing murmur`

#### Deposition of Immune Complexes

- Presence of bacteria in the bloodstream → Formation of circulating immune complexes → Deposition of immune complexes in other tissues (`Glomerulonephritis`, `Vasculitis lesion`)

#### Distant Organs Involvements

- Spread of bacteria into other organs → `Secondary infection` (Osteomyelitis, Septic arthritis, Psoas abscess)
- Pieces of vegetation can break off and embolize distant organs (`Cerebral emboli`, `Pulmonary emboli`, `Systemic emboli`)
- Presence of bacteria toxins and cytokines in the bloodstream → `Fever`, `Chills & Rigor`, `Night sweats`, `Malaise`
