# Chest Pain with Hypertension

> A 45 year old man came in with history of severe retrosternal chest pain for 1 hour duration. He is known to have hypertension and on amlodipine 5 mg once a day for 1 year. On examination, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg on right arm, pulse rate 110/min regular and some features of prostration. What are your differential diagnoses and how would you proceed and give your management plan?

## Clinical Presentation [#1]

- **Patient:** 45-year-old man
- **History:**
  - Severe retrosternal chest pain for 1 hour duration
  - Known history of hypertension, on `amlodipine 5 mg` once a day for 1 year
- **Examination Findings:**

  - Blood pressure: 130/90 mmHg (right arm)
  - Pulse rate: 110/min, regular
  - Features of prostration (extreme physical weakness or collapse)

## Differential Diagnoses

### 1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**

> Conditions where coronary blood supply to heart muscles was blocked, Includes **unstable angina**, **non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**, and **ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**.

1. **Unstable Angina:** Chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion, not relieved by nitroglycerin.
2. **Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI):** Chest pain with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on ECG.
3. **ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):** Chest pain with ST elevation on ECG and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Severe retrosternal chest pain
  - History of hypertension
  - Features of prostration (e.g., sweating, weakness)
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Plaque rupture in coronary artery
  - Formation of thrombus leading to occlusion (in AMI)
  - Reduced blood flow causing myocardial ischemia (in unstable angina)

### 2. **Aortic Dissection**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back
  - History of hypertension
  - Pulse rate discrepancy (though not mentioned, check both arms)
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Tear in the intimal layer of the aorta
  - Blood enters the medial layer, creating a false lumen
  - Compromised blood flow to vital organs

### 3. **Pulmonary Embolism**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Severe chest pain
  - Features of prostration
  - Tachycardia (pulse rate 110/min)
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Embolus lodges in pulmonary artery
  - Obstruction of blood flow to the lungs
  - Increased pulmonary artery pressure and right heart strain

### 4. **Pericarditis**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sharp, pleuritic chest pain
  - Pain worsens with lying down and improves with sitting up
  - Possible friction rub on auscultation
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Inflammation of the pericardium
  - Causes include viral infection, autoimmune disease, and post-MI syndrome

### 5. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Retrosternal chest pain
  - Exacerbated by certain foods or lying down
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Reflux of stomach contents into esophagus
  - Acid irritation of esophageal mucosa
  - Mimics cardiac chest pain

## Management

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate
2. **IV Access**: Establish at least one large-bore IV line.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Administer MONA Protocol for Suspected ACS**:

   - **`Morphine`**: 2-4 mg IV for severe pain not relieved by nitrates.
   - **`Oxygen`**: 2-4 L/min via nasal cannula if SpO2 < 94%.
   - **`Nitrates`**: Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg every 5 minutes, up to 3 doses.
   - **`Aspirin`**: 300 mg chewable.

2. **Evaluate for Reperfusion Therapy** (if ACS is suspected):

   - **Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) [^1]**: If available within 90 minutes, transfer to a facility capable of PCI.
   - **Thrombolysis**: If PCI not available, administer fibrinolytic therapy [^2] (e.g., alteplase).

[^1]: **Primary PCI**: A non-surgical procedure using a catheter to place a stent to open up blood vessels in the heart that have been narrowed by plaque buildup
[^2]: **Fibrinolytic (Thrombolytic) Therapy**: Administration of medication to dissolve blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries

3. **Administer Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation Therapy**:
   - **Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT)**: `Aspirin` + `P2Y12 inhibitor` (`clopidogrel` 300 mg or `ticagrelor` 180 mg).
   - **Anticoagulants**: Unfractionated `heparin` (60 U/kg bolus, then 12 U/kg/hr) or enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours).

### Investigation

1. **ECG**: Obtain 12-lead ECG to assess for ST-segment changes.
2. **Cardiac Biomarkers**: Measure troponins to confirm or rule out AMI.
3. **Chest X-ray**: To rule out other causes of chest pain (e.g., aortic dissection, pulmonary pathology).
4. **Echocardiography**: If aortic dissection or other structural heart disease is suspected.
5. **CT Angiography**: If aortic dissection is suspected.
6. **D-dimer [^3]**: If pulmonary embolism is suspected.

[^3]: **D-Dimer**: It is produced when fibrin, a protein involved in blood clotting, is broken down by plasmin.Elevated levels of D-Dimer indicate the presence of an abnormal blood clotting process in the body.

### Further Management on Specific Diagnosis

#### Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

1. **Beta-Blockers**: Administer if not contraindicated (e.g., IV `metoprolol` 5 mg every 5 minutes up to 15 mg).
2. **Statins**: High-intensity statin therapy (e.g., `atorvastatin` 80 mg).

#### Aortic Dissection

1. **Blood Pressure Control**:
   - **Beta-Blockers**: IV `labetalol` or `esmolol` to reduce heart rate and blood pressure.
   - **Vasodilators**: `Nitroprusside` if additional BP control needed.
2. **Pain Management**:
   - **Analgesics**: `Morphine` for pain control.
3. **Surgical Consultation**: Immediate transfer to a surgical facility for possible emergency surgery.

#### Pulmonary Embolism

1. **Anticoagulation**:
   - **Initial**: IV `heparin` bolus followed by continuous infusion or enoxaparin.
2. **Supportive Care**:
   - **Oxygen Therapy**: Maintain SpO2 > 90%.
3. **Thrombolytic Therapy**: Consider in cases of massive PE with hemodynamic instability.

#### Pericarditis

1. **Anti-inflammatory Therapy**:
   - **NSAIDs**: `Ibuprofen` or `aspirin` for pain and inflammation.
   - **Colchicine**: To reduce symptoms and recurrence.
2. **Supportive Care**:
   - **Analgesics**: For pain relief.
   - **Positioning**: Encourage the patient to sit up and lean forward to relieve pain.

#### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

1. **Symptomatic Relief**:
   - **Antacids**: For immediate relief.
   - **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs)**: `Omeprazole` or `pantoprazole`.
2. **Diet and Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - Avoid trigger foods, elevate head of bed, weight loss if indicated.

### Monitoring and Reassessment

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: ECG, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
2. **Serial Cardiac Biomarkers**: Measure troponins to confirm or rule out AMI.
3. **Repeat Imaging**: If necessary (e.g., CT angiography for aortic dissection, CTPA for pulmonary embolism).

### Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Lifestyle Changes**: Diet, exercise, smoking cessation.
2. **Medications**: Adherence to prescribed medications for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other comorbid conditions.
3. **Regular Follow-Up & Monitoring**: Regular appointments with primary care and relevant specialists, and monitor chronic conditions
4. **Patient Education**: Importance of medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and recognition of symptoms.
5. **Rehabilitation**: Cardiac rehabilitation for patients with ACS.
