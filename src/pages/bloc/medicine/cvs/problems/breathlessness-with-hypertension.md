# Breathlessness with Hypertension

> A 65 year old lady was admitted for sudden onset of shortness of breath for one hour. She had history of breathless on exertion off and on for one month and also she has to sit up at midnight with shortness of breathless for few days. Her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg at the admission. She has history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Discuss about differential diagnosis and management plan for this patient.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 65-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - `Sudden onset` of shortness of breath for one hour
  - Intermittent breathlessness on exertion for one month
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) for a few days
  - Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg at admission
  - Known history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus

## Differential Diagnoses

### 1. **Acute Heart Failure / Acute Pulmonary Edema**

> Acute heart failure oftens leads to acute pulmonary edema.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath
  - Orthopnea (needing to sit up at night due to breathlessness)
  - Hypertension (180/100 mmHg)
  - History of breathlessness on exertion
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Acute myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemia → `Impaired left ventricular function` → Decreased cardiac output → Increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) → Increased left atrial pressure → Increased pulmonary venous pressure → Fluid transudation into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli → `Pulmonary edema`
  - Fluid in alveoli → Impaired gas exchange → Hypoxia (`Breathlessness`)
  - Fluid backs up into the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion and `edema`.

### 2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**

> Conditions where coronary blood supply to heart muscles was blocked, Includes **unstable angina**, **Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**, and **ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath (can be an anginal equivalent)
  - History of hypertension and diabetes (risk factors for coronary artery disease)
  - Orthopnea and exertional breathlessness can indicate cardiac ischemia.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Plaques formation in coronary arteries → Stress, Inflammation cause plaque rupture → Release of thrombogenic materials into bloodstream → Formation of thrombus by platelets ahesion and aggregation → Increase growth → Total occlusion of coronary artery → No oxygen and blood supply to heart muscle (myocardium) → Necrosis (in `Acute Myocardial Infarction`)
  - Partial ooclusion → Reduced oxygen and blood supply → Myocardial ischemia (in `Unstable Angina`)

### 3. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath
  - History of immobility or other risk factors (diabetes can be a risk factor)
  - Possible chest pain or hemoptysis.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Thrombus formation (e.g, in `Deep Vein Thrombosis`) → Thrombus breaks loose and travel through the venous system → Reach pulmonary arteries → Occlusion of pulmonary arteries → No perfusion → Hypoxemia → Worsen by bronchoconstriction of inflammatory mediators → `Secondary pulmonary hypertension`
  - Occlusion of pulmonary arteries → Right ventricular failure → Decrease cardiac output

### 4. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation**

> COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden worsening of shortness of breath.
  - History of chronic breathlessness on exertion.
  - Orthopnea can occur due to diaphragmatic impairment.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - **Airway remodeling**: Chronic inflammation in the airways, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature → Structural changes in the airways → Narrowing and fibrosis
  - Excessive mucus production → Airway obstruction
  - `Emphysema`: Destruction of alveolar walls (protease-antiprotease imbalance) → Loss of elastic recoil and alveolar attachments → Air trapping and hyperinflation
  - Thickening of pulmonary vessels → `Pulmonary hypertension`

### 5. **Pneumonia**

> Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, which may fill with fluid or pus.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath.
  - History of breathlessness on exertion could be indicative of underlying lung pathology.
  - Fever, cough, and sputum production might be present.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Infection in respiratory tract → Release Neutrophils and inflammatory mediators → Damage to alveolar-capillary membrane → Increased permeability → Formation of exudate → Consolidation and impaired gas exchange

## Management

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation.
2. **IV Access**: Establish IV access for potential medication administration.
3. **Focused Physical Examination**: Assess for signs of heart failure, lung disease, and peripheral edema.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy**: Administer oxygen if SpO2 < 94% or if the patient is in respiratory distress.
2. **Positioning**: Sit the patient up to help with breathing.
3. **Monitor and Support**: Continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring.

### Investigation

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To assess for any ischemic changes or arrhythmias.
2. **Chest X-ray**: To evaluate heart size, pulmonary congestion, and other lung pathology.
3. **Blood Tests**:
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To check for anemia or infection.
   - **Serum Electrolytes, BUN, and Creatinine**: To assess kidney function.
   - **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: To evaluate liver function.
   - **Natriuretic Peptides (BNP or NT-proBNP)**: To help diagnose heart failure.
   - **Cardiac Enzymes (Troponins)**: To assess for myocardial infarction.
   - **D-dimer**: If pulmonary embolism is suspected.
4. **Echocardiography**: To assess cardiac function and structure.
5. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: To evaluate gas exchange and acid-base status.
6. **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)**: If COPD is suspected.
7. **Urinalysis**: To assess for proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) or other abnormalities.

### Further Management on Specific Diagnosis
