# Breathlessness with Hypertension

> A 65 year old lady was admitted for sudden onset of shortness of breath for one hour. She had history of breathless on exertion off and on for one month and also she has to sit up at midnight with shortness of breathless for few days. Her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg at the admission. She has history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Discuss about differential diagnosis and management plan for this patient.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 65-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath for one hour
  - Intermittent breathlessness on exertion for one month
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) for a few days
  - Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg at admission
  - Known history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus

## Differential Diagnoses

### 1. **Acute Heart Failure / Acute Pulmonary Edema**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath
  - Orthopnea (needing to sit up at night due to breathlessness)
  - Hypertension (180/100 mmHg)
  - History of breathlessness on exertion
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Elevated blood pressure and diabetes can lead to left ventricular dysfunction.
  - Fluid backs up into the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion and edema.

### 2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath (can be an anginal equivalent)
  - History of hypertension and diabetes (risk factors for coronary artery disease)
  - Orthopnea and exertional breathlessness can indicate cardiac ischemia.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Plaque rupture or thrombosis in coronary arteries leading to myocardial ischemia or infarction.
  - Reduced cardiac output and pulmonary congestion can result.

### 3. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath
  - History of immobility or other risk factors (diabetes can be a risk factor)
  - Possible chest pain or hemoptysis.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Thrombus lodges in pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow.
  - Increased pulmonary artery pressure and strain on the right heart.

### 4. **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden worsening of shortness of breath.
  - History of chronic breathlessness on exertion.
  - Orthopnea can occur due to diaphragmatic impairment.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Chronic inflammation and narrowing of the airways.
  - Acute exacerbation can be triggered by infection or other factors, leading to increased airway resistance and gas trapping.

### 5. **Pneumonia**

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath.
  - History of breathlessness on exertion could be indicative of underlying lung pathology.
  - Fever, cough, and sputum production might be present.
- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Infection of the lung parenchyma.
  - Inflammatory response causes alveolar filling and impaired gas exchange.
