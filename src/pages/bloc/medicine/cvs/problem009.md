# Chest Pain in Obese Person

> A 50 year old obese man was admitted to medical ward with severe central chest pain. Discuss the differential diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)**

- **Unstable Angina:** Chest pain at rest or with minimal exertion, not relieved by nitroglycerin.
- **Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI):** Chest pain with elevated cardiac biomarkers but no ST elevation on ECG.
- **ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI):** Chest pain with ST elevation on ECG and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

### 2. **Aortic Dissection**

- Sudden, severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back.
- May present with different blood pressures in each arm.

### 3. **Pulmonary Embolism**

- Sudden onset of sharp, pleuritic chest pain, often associated with dyspnea.
- Risk factors include prolonged immobility, recent surgery, or history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

### 4. **Pericarditis**

- Sharp, pleuritic chest pain that improves with sitting up and leaning forward.
- May have a pericardial friction rub on auscultation.

### 5. **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**

- Burning chest pain, often related to meals and lying down.
- May be relieved by antacids.

### 6. **Peptic Ulcer Disease**

- Epigastric pain that can mimic cardiac chest pain.
- May be related to meals and relieved by antacids.

### 7. **Musculoskeletal Pain**

- Costochondritis: Pain localized to the chest wall, often reproducible with palpation.
- Muscle strain: Associated with recent physical activity or trauma.

### 8. **Pneumothorax**

- Sudden onset of sharp, unilateral chest pain and dyspnea.
- Decreased breath sounds on the affected side.

### 9. **Pneumonia or Pleuritis**

- Pleuritic chest pain with fever, cough, and signs of infection.
- May have localized crackles or decreased breath sounds.

### 10. **Esophageal Spasm**

- Severe, squeezing chest pain that can mimic angina.
- Often related to swallowing and may be relieved by nitrates or calcium channel blockers.

## Initial Assessment and Investigations

### History and Physical Examination

- Detailed history of the chest pain: onset, duration, quality, radiation, aggravating and relieving factors.
- Review of risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, family history of cardiovascular disease.
- Comprehensive physical examination: vital signs, cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and musculoskeletal systems.

### Diagnostic Tests

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes, arrhythmias, or signs of pericarditis.

2. **Cardiac Biomarkers:**

   - Troponin I or T, CK-MB to assess for myocardial injury.

3. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To evaluate for aortic dissection, pneumothorax, pneumonia, or other thoracic pathology.

4. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To assess cardiac function, wall motion abnormalities, and pericardial effusion.

5. **D-dimer:**

   - To rule out pulmonary embolism if clinically suspected.

6. **CT Angiography:**

   - To diagnose aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism if indicated.

7. **Upper GI Endoscopy or Esophageal Manometry:**
   - To evaluate for GERD or esophageal spasm if suspected.

## Conclusion

- Severe central chest pain in a 50-year-old obese man can have multiple etiologies, ranging from life-threatening conditions like ACS and aortic dissection to less critical causes like GERD and musculoskeletal pain.
- A systematic approach including a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic tests is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
