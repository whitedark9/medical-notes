# Rheumatic Heart Disease wtih Dyspnea and Cough

> A 55 year old lady with rheumatic heart disease was admitted with acute dyspnoea, orthopnoea and cough with frothy blood stained sputum. How would you manage her?

> A 30 year old lady with history of rheumatic mitral stenosis was admitted for acute breathlessness associated with cough and frothy expectoration. Outline the management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 55-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Rheumatic heart disease
  - `Acute` dyspnea
  - Orthopnea
  - Cough with frothy blood-stained sputum

## Likely Diagnosis

The presentation suggests `acute pulmonary edema`, likely secondary to decompensated `heart failure` due to rheumatic heart disease.

## Clinical Features Supporting Diagnosis

- **Acute dyspnea**: Sudden onset of shortness of breath.
- **Orthopnea**: Difficulty breathing when lying flat.
- **Cough with frothy blood-stained sputum**: Indicative of pulmonary edema.
- **History of rheumatic heart disease**: Suggests potential valvular dysfunction.

## Management

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs Monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation.
2. **Focused Physical Examination**: Check for signs of pulmonary edema, such as crackles on lung auscultation, and evaluate for signs of heart failure.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy**: Administer high-flow oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 94%.
2. **Positioning**: Sit the patient upright to help with breathing and reduce venous return to the heart.
3. **IV Access**: Establish IV access for potential medication administration.
4. **Diuretics**: IV `furosemide` to reduce fluid overload.
5. **ACE Inhibitors/ARBs**: To manage hypertension and reduce cardiac workload. (e.g., `enalapril`, `losartan`).
6. **Vasodilators**: `Nitroglycerin` to reduce preload and afterload (if blood pressure allows).
7. **Morphine**: For pain relief and to reduce preload (if not contraindicated).

### Investigation

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: To assess for any ischemic changes or arrhythmias.
2. **Chest X-ray**: To confirm pulmonary edema and evaluate heart size.
3. **Blood Tests**:
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: To assess for infection or anemia.
   - **Serum Electrolytes, BUN, and Creatinine**: To evaluate renal function and electrolyte status.
   - **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: To check for hepatic congestion.
   - **Natriuretic Peptides (BNP or NT-proBNP)**: To help diagnose heart failure.
4. **Echocardiography**: To assess valvular function and measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
5. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: To evaluate gas exchange and acid-base status.

### Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Edema

1. **Ongoing Diuretics**: Continue diuretics based on response and renal function.
2. **Inotropes**: If there is evidence of reduced cardiac output and hypotension, consider inotropic support [^1] (e.g., `dobutamine`).
3. **Mechanical Ventilation**: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) such as CPAP or BiPAP may be necessary if the patient is in severe respiratory distress. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required in refractory cases.
4. **Address Underlying Cause**:
   - For mitral valve disease secondary to rheumatic heart disease, consider surgical or percutaneous intervention (e.g., mitral valve repair or replacement).

[^1]: **Inotropic Support**: Medical therapy aimed at increasing the contractility of the heart muscle to improve cardiac output and support circulatory function

### Monitoring and Reassessment

1. **Frequent Monitoring**: Vital signs, urine output, and oxygen saturation.
2. **Repeat Blood Tests**: Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and BNP levels.
3. **Clinical Response**: Regular assessment of symptoms and physical examination findings.

### Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - Dietary sodium restriction.
   - Fluid management.
   - Weight monitoring.
1. **Prevention of Recurrent Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)**
   - **Primary Prophylaxis**: To prevent the initial episode of ARF after a streptococcal throat infection.
   - **Secondary Prophylaxis**: Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent recurrent ARF.
   - **Preferred Regimen**:
     - `Benzathine Penicillin G`: 1.2 million units IM every 3-4 weeks.
   - **Alternatives**:
     - `Penicillin V`: 250 mg orally twice daily.
     - `Sulfadiazine`: 1 g orally daily (if penicillin-allergic).
     - `Erythromycin`: 250 mg orally twice daily (if penicillin-allergic).
   - **Duration of Prophylaxis**:
     - **Without Carditis**: Continue for at least 5 years or until age 21, whichever is longer.
     - **With Carditis but No Residual Heart Disease**: Continue for 10 years or until age 21, whichever is longer.
     - **With Residual Heart Disease**: Continue for 10 years or until at least age 40; may be lifelong.
1. **Regular Follow-Up & Monitoring**: Regular appointments with cardiologist, and monitor chronic conditions
1. **Patient Education**: Importance of medication adherence, recognizing symptoms of heart failure exacerbation, and seeking early medical attention.

## Acute Pulmonary Edema

> Acute pulmonary edema is a rapid accumulation of fluid in the alveoli and interstitial spaces of the lungs, leading to severe respiratory distress.

### Pathophysiology

- Rheumatic heart disease → mitral valve stenosis or regurgitation → Increase pressures in the left atrium → `Impaired left ventricular function` → Decreased cardiac output → Increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) → Increased left atrial pressure → Increased pulmonary venous pressure → Fluid transudation into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli → `Pulmonary edema`
- Fluid in alveoli → Impaired gas exchange → Hypoxia (`Breathlessness`)
- Fluid backs up into the lungs, causing pulmonary congestion and `edema`.
