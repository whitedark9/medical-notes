# Rheumatic Heart Disease with Dyspnoea, Orthopnoea

> A 55 year old lady with rheumatic heart disease was admitted with acute dyspnoea, orthopnoea and cough with frothy blood stained sputum. How would you manage her?

> A 30 year old lady with history of rheumatic mitral stenosis was admitted for acute breathlessness associated with cough and frothy expectoration. Outline the management plan.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 55-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Rheumatic heart disease
  - Acute dyspnea
  - Orthopnea
  - Cough with frothy blood-stained sputum

## Likely Diagnosis

The presentation suggests `acute pulmonary edema`, likely secondary to decompensated `heart failure` due to rheumatic heart disease. `Mitral stenosis` or `mitral regurgitation`, common complications of rheumatic heart disease, could precipitate this condition.

## Immediate Management Plan

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs:**

   - Blood pressure
   - Heart rate
   - Respiratory rate
   - Oxygen saturation.

2. **Physical Examination:**
   - Crackles/rales in the lungs
   - Heart murmurs
   - Jugular venous distension
   - Peripheral edema.

> Acute condition starts with treatment before investigation.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy:**

   - `High-flow oxygen` via face mask or non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 94%.
   - Consider non-invasive ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

2. **Positioning:**

   - Keep the patient in an `upright position` to reduce pulmonary congestion.

3. **Diuretics:**

   - `IV Furosemide` to reduce fluid overload and alleviate pulmonary congestion.

4. **Vasodilators:**

   - `IV Nitroglycerin` to reduce preload and afterload, provided blood pressure is adequate.

5. **`Morphine`:**

   - For symptom relief, to reduce anxiety and dyspnea.

### Monitoring

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring:**
  - To detect arrhythmias.
- **Frequent Vital Signs Monitoring:**
  - BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Investigations

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

2. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To assess the extent of pulmonary edema and rule out other causes.

3. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To evaluate the severity of valvular disease and assess left ventricular function.

4. **Blood Tests:**

   - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - Basic Metabolic Panel
   - B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP)
   - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

5. **Physical Examination:**
   - Auscultation for crackles/rales in the lungs
   - Presence of S3 or S4 heart sounds
   - Signs of peripheral edema

### Advanced Management

1. **Cardiology Consultation:**

   - For further management and potential intervention (e.g., valvuloplasty or valve replacement if indicated).

2. **Definitive Treatment:**

   - Management of the underlying rheumatic heart disease:
     - Consideration of surgical or percutaneous intervention for mitral stenosis or regurgitation.
     - Long-term anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation is present.
     - Management of heart failure with `ACE inhibitors`, `beta-blockers`, and `diuretics` as needed.

3. **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:**
   - `Penicillin V`, `Amoxillin`, `Benzathine Pencillin G`, `Erythromycin`
   - For rheumatic fever prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of rheumatic heart disease.

### Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Education:**

   - Importance of medication adherence.
   - Recognizing early signs of heart failure exacerbation.
   - Lifestyle modifications (diet, fluid restriction, avoiding excessive salt intake).

2. **Follow-up:**
   - Regular follow-up with a cardiologist.
   - Monitoring of cardiac function and management of comorbid conditions.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has acute pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure from rheumatic heart disease.
- Immediate management involves stabilizing the patient with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators, while monitoring vital signs closely.
- Further investigations and specialist consultations are essential for definitive management of the underlying valvular pathology and long-term care.
