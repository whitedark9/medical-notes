# Angina Pectoris

> Describe the clinical manifestations and management of stable angina pectoris.

> Angina pectoris is chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, typically triggered by physical exertion or stree.

## Clinical Manifestations

### Chest Pain (**SOCRATES**)

1. **S**ite:

   - Typically retrosternal (behind the breastbone).

2. **O**nset:

   - Often gradual, occurring during physical exertion, emotional stress, exposure to cold weather, or after heavy meals.

3. **C**haracter:

   - Described as a pressure, squeezing, tightness, or heaviness.

4. **R**adiation:

   - May radiate to the left arm, neck, jaw, or back.

5. **A**ssociated Symptoms:

   - Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
   - Nausea
   - Sweating
   - Fatigue
   - Light-headedness or dizziness

6. **T**iming:

   - Typically lasts for a few minutes (1-5 minutes), rarely more than 15 minutes.
   - Predictable and reproducible with similar levels of exertion or stress.

7. **E**xacerbating Factors:

   - Physical exertion
   - Emotional stress
   - Cold weather
   - Heavy meals

8. Relieving Factors:
   - Rest
   - Sublingual `nitroglycerin` typically relieves the pain within a few minutes.

### Physical Examination

- Often normal between episodes of angina.
- During an episode, signs of ischemia may be present, such as:
  - Increased heart rate
  - Increased blood pressure
  - Possible transient S4 (atrial gallop) or murmur due to papillary muscle dysfunction.

## Management

### Initial Assessment

1. **History and Physical Examination**:
   - Detailed history to differentiate from `other causes of chest pain` and assess for risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking).

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Relief of Symptoms**:
   - **Sublingual `Nitroglycerin`**: To relieve acute chest pain. Can be repeated every 5 minutes up to three doses. If pain persists, seek emergency care.

### Investigation

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**:
   - Baseline ECG to look for ischemic changes, which may be normal between episodes.
1. **Laboratory Tests**:
   - **Cardiac Biomarkers**: Typically normal in stable angina.
   - **Lipid Profile**: To assess cardiovascular risk.
   - **Blood Glucose and HbA1c**: To check for diabetes.
1. **Exercise Stress Test**:
   - To provoke symptoms and ischemic changes on ECG, which can help confirm the diagnosis.
1. **Stress Imaging** (if the exercise stress test is inconclusive or if the patient cannot exercise):
   - **Stress Echocardiography**: To evaluate for wall motion abnormalities.
   - **Nuclear Perfusion Imaging**: To assess for areas of reduced blood flow.
1. **Coronary Angiography**:
   - Considered if non-invasive tests are inconclusive or if there is high suspicion of significant coronary artery disease (CAD).

### Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis of Stable Angina

#### Medications

- **Antiplatelet Therapy**: `Aspirin` (75-162 mg daily) to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.
- **Beta-Blockers**: To reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand (e.g., `metoprolol`, `atenolol`).
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: If beta-blockers are contraindicated or not effective (e.g., `amlodipine`, `diltiazem`).
- **Long-acting Nitrates**: For ongoing angina relief (e.g., `isosorbide` `mononitrate`).
- **Ranolazine**: For patients who remain symptomatic despite other therapies.
- **Statins**: To manage hyperlipidemia and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
- **ACE Inhibitors/ARBs**: For patients with hypertension, diabetes, or left ventricular dysfunction.

#### Risk Factor Management

- **Hypertension**: Strict blood pressure control.
- **Diabetes**: Tight glycemic control.
- **Hyperlipidemia**: Aggressive lipid management with statins and possibly other lipid-lowering agents.

### Follow-up and Long-term Management

1. **Lifestyle Modifications**:
   - **Smoking Cessation**: Essential for reducing cardiovascular risk.
   - **Diet**: Low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol; rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
   - **Exercise**: Regular physical activity as tolerated.
   - **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.
1. **Regular Follow-up & Monitoring**:
   - To assess symptom control, medication adherence, and management of risk factors.
   - To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and to detect any progression of disease.
1. **Patient Education**:
   - On recognizing symptoms of angina, proper use of nitroglycerin, and when to seek medical attention.
1. **Cardiac Rehabilitation**:
   - Referral to a structured program if available, for supervised exercise, education, and support.
1. **Periodic Review**:
   - With a cardiologist to reassess the risk profile and adjust treatment as necessary.
