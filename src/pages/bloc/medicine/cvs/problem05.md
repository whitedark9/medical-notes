# Breathlessness in Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus

> A 65 year old lady was admitted for sudden onset of shortness of breath for one hour. She had history of breathless on exertion off and on for one month and also she has to sit up at midnight with shortness of breathless for few days. Her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg at the admission. She has history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Discuss about differential diagnosis and management plan for this patient.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Patient:** 65-year-old woman
- **History:**
  - Sudden onset of shortness of breath for one hour
  - Intermittent breathlessness on exertion for one month
  - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) for a few days
  - Blood pressure: 180/100 mmHg at admission
  - Known history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus

## Differential Diagnoses

1. **Acute Pulmonary Edema:**

   - Sudden onset dyspnea, PND, and history of `hypertension` suggest `acute left ventricular failure` leading to `pulmonary edema`.

2. **Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): [^1]**

   - Can present with acute dyspnea and may be complicated by heart failure.

[^1]: **Acute Coronary Syndrome**: Conditions where coronary blood supply to heart muscles was blocked, Includes `unstable angina`, `non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)`, and `ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)`.

3. **Chronic Heart Failure with Acute Decompensation:**

   - Progressive symptoms of heart failure exacerbated by uncontrolled hypertension.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism: [^2]**

   - Sudden onset dyspnea; consider especially if there are risk factors for thrombosis (e.g., Deep Vein Thrombosis).

[^2]: **Pulmonary Embolism**: ~~Meical Emergency~~; One of the pulmonary arteries is blocked by a blood clot.

5. **Hypertensive Emergency:**

   - Severe hypertension causing acute heart failure or other end-organ damage.

6. **Pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Infection:**
   - Can cause acute dyspnea, especially in an elderly patient with comorbidities.

## Immediate Management Plan

### Initial Assessment

1. **Vital Signs:**

   - Blood pressure
   - Heart rate
   - Respiratory rate
   - Oxygen saturation.

2. **Physical Examination:**
   - Crackles/rales in the lungs
   - Heart murmurs
   - Jugular venous distension
   - Peripheral edema.

### Immediate Treatment

1. **Oxygen Therapy:**

   - `High-flow oxygen` via face mask or non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 94%.

2. **Positioning:**

   - Keep the patient in an `upright position` to reduce pulmonary congestion.

3. **Diuretics:**

   - `IV Furosemide` to reduce fluid overload and alleviate pulmonary congestion.

4. **Vasodilators:**

   - `IV Nitroglycerin` to reduce preload and afterload, provided blood pressure is adequate.

5. **`Morphine`:**

   - For symptom relief, to reduce anxiety and dyspnea.

6. **`Antihypertensives`:**
   - IV agents such as `Labetalol` or `Nicardipine` to control severe hypertension.

### Monitoring

- **Continuous ECG Monitoring:**
  - To detect arrhythmias and ischemic changes.
- **Frequent Vital Signs Monitoring:**
  - BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

### Investigations

1. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

   - To identify ischemic changes or arrhythmias.

2. **Chest X-ray:**

   - To assess for pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly, or other lung pathology.

3. **Echocardiogram:**

   - To evaluate cardiac function, valve status, and left ventricular ejection fraction.

4. **Blood Tests:**

   - Complete Blood Count (CBC)
   - Basic Metabolic Panel
   - Cardiac Biomarkers: Troponin I or T, CK-MB
   - B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP)
   - Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) if severe respiratory distress or hypoxia persists.

5. **D-dimer: [^3]**
   - To rule out pulmonary embolism if clinically suspected.

[^3]: **D-Dimer**: It is produced when fibrin, a protein involved in blood clotting, is broken down by plasmin.Elevated levels of D-Dimer indicate the presence of an abnormal blood clotting process in the body.

### Advanced Management

1. **Cardiology Consultation:**

   - For further evaluation and management, including possible intervention for ACS or heart failure.

2. **Definitive Treatment:**

   - Management of underlying causes:
     - If ACS, consider `reperfusion therapy` (PCI or thrombolysis).
     - If heart failure, long-term management with `ACE inhibitors`, `beta-blockers`, and `diuretics`.
     - If pulmonary embolism, `anticoagulation therapy`.

3. **Blood Pressure Control:**

   - Long-term antihypertensive management to prevent recurrence and end-organ damage.

4. **Glycemic Control:**
   - Adjust diabetes medications as needed for optimal control.

### Patient Education and Follow-up

1. **Education:**

   - Importance of medication adherence for hypertension and diabetes.
   - Recognizing early signs of heart failure or ACS.
   - Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, fluid restriction, low-salt diet).

2. **Follow-up:**
   - Regular follow-up with a cardiologist.
   - Monitoring of cardiac function and management of comorbid conditions.

## Conclusion

- This patient likely has acute pulmonary edema secondary to decompensated heart failure, possibly precipitated by hypertensive crisis.
- Immediate management involves stabilizing the patient with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators while closely monitoring vital signs.
- Further investigations and specialist consultations are essential for definitive management of the underlying pathology and long-term care.
