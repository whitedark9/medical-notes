# Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB)

> Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF), the two most potent TB drugs.

## Causes and Risk Factors

- **Incomplete or Improper Treatment**: Inadequate drug regimens, poor patient adherence.
- **Transmission**: Direct transmission from individuals with MDR-TB.
- **HIV Co-Infection**: Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible.
- **Previous TB Treatment**: Higher risk in patients with prior TB treatment, especially if it was incomplete or inadequate.

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Evaluation**: Symptoms like chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and hemoptysis.
- **Microbiological Tests**:
  - Sputum smear microscopy.
  - Culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST).
  - Rapid molecular tests (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) to detect rifampicin resistance.
- **Radiological Evaluation**: Chest X-rays or CT scans to assess lung involvement.

## Treatment Principles

- **Combination Therapy**: Use of multiple drugs to prevent resistance development.
- **Longer Duration**: Treatment typically lasts 18-24 months.
- **Individualized Regimens**: Based on drug susceptibility testing (DST).

## WHO Recommended Treatment Regimens

### Standard Regimen (Longer Treatment)

1. **Intensive Phase (8 months)**:

   - `Kanamycin` (or `Amikacin`, `Capreomycin`, `Streptomycin`)
   - `Levofloxacin` (or `Moxifloxacin`)
   - `Ethionamide` (or `Prothionamide`)
   - `Cycloserine` (or `Terizidone`)
   - `Pyrazinamide` (Z)
   - `Ethambutol` (E)
   - High-dose `Isoniazid` (H)

2. **Continuation Phase (12-16 months)**:
   - `Levofloxacin` (or `Moxifloxacin`)
   - `Ethionamide` (or `Prothionamide`)
   - `Cycloserine` (or `Terizidone`)
   - `Ethambutol` (E)

### Shorter Regimen (9-12 months)

> For selected patients who have not been previously treated with second-line drugs and who do not have resistance to `fluoroquinolones` or second-line injectable drugs.

1. **Intensive Phase (4-6 months):**
   - `Kanamycin` (or `Amikacin`)
   - `Moxifloxacin`
   - `Prothionamide`
   - `Clofazimine`
   - `Pyrazinamide` (Z)
   - `Ethambutol` (E)
   - High-dose `Isoniazid` (H)
2. **Continuation Phase (5 months)**:
   - `Moxifloxacin`
   - `Clofazimine`
   - `Pyrazinamide` (Z)
   - `Ethambutol` (E)

## Newer Medications and Regimens

- **`Bedaquiline`**: A diarylquinoline used in combination with other drugs, particularly for patients with limited options due to resistance.
- **`Delamanid`**: A nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative used in combination with other drugs for treating MDR TB.
- **All-Oral Regimens**: WHO now recommends all-oral regimens whenever possible to avoid injectable drugs.

## Monitoring and Follow-Up

- **Monthly Sputum Cultures**: To monitor treatment response.
- **Adverse Effect Monitoring**: Regular assessments for drug toxicity.
- **Adherence Support**: Counseling and support to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen.
- **HIV Testing**: All TB patients should be tested for HIV.

## Preventive Measures

- **Infection Control**: Use of masks, proper ventilation, and isolation of infectious patients.
- **Screening and Prophylaxis**: Regular screening of high-risk populations and prophylactic treatment for latent TB in contacts of MDR-TB patients.
- **Vaccination**: BCG vaccination in endemic areas.

## Prognosis

- **Early Diagnosis and Effective Treatment**: Key to a favorable outcome.
- **Treatment Adherence**: Critical to prevent the development of further drug resistance and achieve cure.
- **Mortality and Morbidity**: Higher in MDR-TB compared to drug-susceptible TB, especially if associated with HIV.
