# Thiamine Deficiency

> A condition resulting from inadequate levels of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the body, leading to various systemic effects, particularly in the nervous and cardiovascular systems.

## Questions

> List the conditions caused by vitamin deficiency common in our country. Describe briefly about the thiamin deficiency.

> Describe the various manifestations and treatment of thiamine deficiency.

## Thiamine Deficiency Manifestations

### 1. **Beriberi**

#### Dry Beriberi

- **Peripheral Neuropathy**:
  - Thiamine is essential for energy production via the Krebs cycle.
  - Thiamine deficiency → Decreased ATP production in neurons → Impaired nerve function → Axonal degeneration → Peripheral neuropathy, manifesting as muscle weakness, paresthesia, and loss of reflexes.
- **Muscle Weakness**:
  - Lack of energy production in muscles due to deficient thiamine → Muscle fatigue and weakness, particularly in the lower extremities.

#### Wet Beriberi

- **Cardiomegaly and Tachycardia**:
  - Thiamine deficiency → Decreased myocardial energy production → Weakened heart muscle contractions → Compensatory mechanisms (tachycardia) to maintain cardiac output → Cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomegaly.
- **High-output Heart Failure**:
  - Impaired myocardial energy production → Heart unable to pump efficiently → Compensatory mechanisms lead to increased heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance → Fluid retention and edema → High-output heart failure.
- **Peripheral Edema**:
  - Increased capillary permeability and fluid retention due to heart failure → Accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces → Peripheral edema.

### 2. **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome**

#### Wernicke Encephalopathy

- **Confusion, Ophthalmoplegia, and Ataxia**:
  - Thiamine deficiency → Impaired glucose metabolism in the brain, particularly in the thalamus and hypothalamus → Neuronal damage → Confusion, eye movement abnormalities (ophthalmoplegia), and loss of coordination (ataxia).

#### Korsakoff Syndrome

- **Memory Loss and Confabulation**:
  - Chronic thiamine deficiency → Permanent damage to the mammillary bodies and thalamic nuclei → Disruption of memory processing → Anterograde and retrograde amnesia with confabulation to fill memory gaps.

### 3. **Other Symptoms**

- **Anorexia and Weight Loss**:
  - Thiamine deficiency → Impaired function of the gastrointestinal system → Reduced appetite (anorexia) and subsequent weight loss.
- **Fatigue and Irritability**:
  - Thiamine is crucial for energy metabolism and nervous system function.
  - Thiamine deficiency → Energy production declines and neurotransmitter imbalances → Fatigue and mood changes, such as irritability.

## Treatment

### Initial Assessment

- Evaluate clinical symptoms and history of dietary intake.
- Consider risk factors (e.g., alcohol use disorder, malnutrition).

### Immediate Treatment

- Administer thiamine immediately, particularly if Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is suspected.
- **IV Thiamine**:
  - `100 mg IV, three times daily for 2-3 days` for suspected Wernicke's encephalopathy.
  - Follow with `oral thiamine (100 mg daily)`.

### Investigation to Confirm Diagnosis

- Serum thiamine level (not always readily available).
- Erythrocyte transketolase activity (more specific but rarely done).

### Further Management on Confirm Diagnosis

- **Dietary Modification**:
  - Encourage a diet rich in thiamine (e.g., whole grains, legumes, nuts).
- **Supplementation**:
  - Continue `oral thiamine 100 mg daily` for several weeks.
- **Treat underlying causes** (e.g., alcohol use disorder, malabsorption).

### Long-term Management and Follow-up

- Monitor for resolution of symptoms.
- Educate the patient on maintaining a thiamine-rich diet.
- Address any ongoing risk factors for deficiency.
