# Jaundice

> A 55 year old man was admitted to medical ward for increasing yellow discoloration of sclera for 10 days duration. Discuss differential diagnoses and plan to reach definite diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnoses for Jaundice in a 55-Year-Old Man

### 1. **Hepatocellular Jaundice**

- **Common Causes:**
  - **Viral Hepatitis** (e.g., Hepatitis B, C)
  - **Alcoholic Hepatitis**
  - **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)**
  - **Cirrhosis** (due to various etiologies)
- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Liver cell injury → Impaired conjugation of bilirubin → Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood → Jaundice.

### 2. **Cholestatic (Obstructive) Jaundice**

- **Common Causes:**
  - **Gallstones** (choledocholithiasis)
  - **Biliary Strictures**
  - **Pancreatic Carcinoma**
  - **Cholangiocarcinoma**
- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Obstruction of bile flow → Accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in the blood → Jaundice.

### 3. **Hemolytic Jaundice**

- **Common Causes:**
  - **Hemolytic Anemia** (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary spherocytosis)
  - **G6PD Deficiency**
- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Increased destruction of red blood cells → Overproduction of unconjugated bilirubin → Exceeding liver’s capacity to conjugate → Jaundice.

### 4. **Drug-induced Jaundice**

- **Common Causes:**
  - **Hepatotoxic drugs** (e.g., acetaminophen, statins, antibiotics)
- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) → Hepatocellular or cholestatic injury → Jaundice.

### 5. **Inherited Disorders**

- **Common Causes:**
  - **Gilbert’s Syndrome**
  - **Crigler-Najjar Syndrome**
  - **Dubin-Johnson Syndrome**
- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Genetic defects in bilirubin metabolism → Accumulation of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin → Jaundice.

## Plan to Reach a Definite Diagnosis

### 1. **Initial Assessment**

- **History:**
  - Duration and progression of jaundice.
  - Symptoms: Abdominal pain, pruritus, weight loss, fatigue, dark urine, pale stools.
  - Past medical history: Liver disease, alcohol use, gallstones, drug history.
  - Family history of liver disease or hemolytic disorders.
- **Physical Examination:**
  - **General appearance:** Jaundice, cachexia.
  - **Abdominal examination:** Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, tenderness over liver or gallbladder.
  - **Signs of chronic liver disease:** Spider angiomas, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy.

### 2. **Laboratory Investigations**

- **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):**
  - **Total and Direct Bilirubin**: Elevated in jaundice; helps distinguish between conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia.
  - **ALT, AST**: Elevated in hepatocellular injury.
  - **ALP, GGT**: Elevated in cholestasis.
  - **Albumin and INR**: Assesses liver synthetic function.
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
  - **Hemoglobin, Reticulocyte Count**: Assess for hemolysis.
- **Coagulation Profile:**
  - **PT/INR**: Prolonged in liver dysfunction.
- **Viral Serologies:**
  - **Hepatitis B, C serologies**.
- **Autoimmune markers:**
  - **ANA, SMA, AMA**: For autoimmune hepatitis and PBC.
- **Hemolysis Workup:**
  - **LDH, Haptoglobin, Peripheral Blood Smear**: To assess for hemolysis.

### 3. **Imaging**

- **Ultrasound Abdomen:**
  - Evaluate liver texture, bile ducts, and presence of gallstones or masses.
- **CT Abdomen:**
  - Detailed assessment of liver, pancreas, and biliary tree if ultrasound is inconclusive.
- **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography):**
  - Detailed imaging of the biliary and pancreatic ducts for obstructive causes.

### 4. **Further Diagnostic Procedures**

- **Liver Biopsy:**
  - If imaging and labs are inconclusive or to assess specific liver diseases (e.g., cirrhosis, NAFLD).
- **ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography):**
  - Diagnostic and therapeutic in obstructive jaundice.

### 5. **Definitive Diagnosis**

- Based on the combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.
- Treatment will depend on the confirmed underlying cause, ranging from medical management for hepatitis to surgical intervention for obstructive causes.
