# Complications of Diabetes Mellitus

> Diabetes mellitus is a group of chronic metabolic disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both

**Diabetes mellitus** (DM) can lead to a variety of complications due to chronic hyperglycemia, which affects multiple organ systems. These complications are categorized as **acute**, **microvascular**, **macrovascular**, and **other**.

## 1. Acute Complications

### Hypoglycemia

- **Pathophysiology**: Excessive insulin administration or inadequate glucose intake → Blood glucose drops too low → Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and neuroglycopenic symptoms.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Sweating
  - Tremors
  - Palpitations
  - Confusion
  - Seizures
  - Coma

### Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

- **Pathophysiology**: Insulin deficiency → Increased lipolysis → Free fatty acids converted to ketones in the liver → Metabolic acidosis.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Polyuria
  - Polydipsia (thirst)
  - Polyphagia (hunger)
  - Fruity breath odor (due to ketones)
  - Kussmaul respirations (Deep, labored breathing pattern)
  - Abdominal pain (due to acidosis & electrolyte imbalances)
  - Altered mental status (dehydration & acidosis affect cerebral perfusion)

### Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)

- **Pathophysiology**: Severe hyperglycemia without significant ketosis → Hyperosmolarity → Dehydration and altered mental status.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Extreme hyperglycemia
  - Dehydration
  - Weakness
  - Confusion
  - Coma

## 2. Microvascular Complications

### Diabetic Retinopathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic hyperglycemia → Damage to retinal blood vessels → Microaneurysms, hemorrhages, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Vision changes
  - Potential blindness

### Diabetic Nephropathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Glomerular hyperfiltration (increased GFR initially) → Glomerular hypertrophy and hyperplasia → Scarring and firbrosis → Reduced GFR → Renal failure → Proteinuria, Hypertension and Edema, Uremia
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Proteinuria
  - Hypertension
  - Edema
  - Renal failure.

### Diabetic Neuropathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Damage to nerve fibers and microvasculature → Oxidative stress and inflammation → Sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve dysfunction.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Numbness
  - Tingling
  - Pain (peripheral neuropathy)
  - Gastroparesis
  - Orthostatic hypotension (autonomic neuropathy)

## 3. Macrovascular Complications

### Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Endothelial dysfunction, increased atherosclerosis [^1] → Narrowing of coronary arteries → Myocardial ischemia and infarction.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Angina
  - Myocardial infarction
  - Heart failure

### Cerebrovascular Disease

- **Pathophysiology**: Similar mechanism as CAD → Atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries → Ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Stroke symptoms
  - TIAs

### Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)

- **Pathophysiology**: Atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries → Reduced blood flow to the limbs → Ischemia.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Claudication [^2]
  - Non-healing ulcers
  - Gangrene

## 4. Other Complications

### Infections

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia impairs immune function (e.g., neutrophil activity, chemotaxis) → Increased susceptibility to infections.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Frequent infections
  - Slow wound healing
  - Skin infections
  - Urinary tract infections

### Diabetic Foot Ulcers

- **Pathophysiology**: Combination of neuropathy (loss of sensation) and PAD (poor blood flow) → Minor trauma progresses to ulcers → Risk of infection and gangrene.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Non-healing ulcers
  - Risk of amputation.

[^1]: **Atherosclerosis**: Thickening and hardening of the arte ries due to plaque buildup.
[^2]: **Claudication**: Pain caused by too little blood flow, typically during exercise, due to PAD.
