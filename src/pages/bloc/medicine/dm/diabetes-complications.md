# Complications of Diabetes Mellitus

> Diabetes mellitus is a group of chronic metabolic disorders characterized by high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both

**Diabetes mellitus** (DM) can lead to a variety of complications due to chronic hyperglycemia, which affects multiple organ systems. These complications are categorized as **acute**, **microvascular**, **macrovascular**, and **other**.

## 1. Acute Complications

### Hypoglycemia

- **Pathophysiology**: Excessive insulin administration or inadequate glucose intake → Blood glucose drops too low → Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and neuroglycopenic symptoms.
- **Manifestations**: Sweating, tremors, palpitations, confusion, seizures, coma.

### Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

- **Pathophysiology**: Insulin deficiency → Increased lipolysis → Free fatty acids converted to ketones in the liver → Metabolic acidosis.
- **Manifestations**: Polyuria, polydipsia, fruity breath odor, Kussmaul respirations, abdominal pain, altered mental status.

### Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)

- **Pathophysiology**: Severe hyperglycemia without significant ketosis → Hyperosmolarity → Dehydration and altered mental status.
- **Manifestations**: Extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, weakness, confusion, coma.

## 2. Microvascular Complications

### Diabetic Retinopathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic hyperglycemia → Damage to retinal blood vessels → Microaneurysms, hemorrhages, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization.
- **Manifestations**: Vision changes, potential blindness.

### Diabetic Nephropathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Glycation of proteins and increased pressure in glomerular capillaries → Glomerular basement membrane thickening and sclerosis → Proteinuria and progressive kidney failure.
- **Manifestations**: Proteinuria, hypertension, renal failure.

### Diabetic Neuropathy

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Damage to nerve fibers and microvasculature → Oxidative stress and inflammation → Sensory, motor, and autonomic nerve dysfunction.
- **Manifestations**: Numbness, tingling, pain (peripheral neuropathy), gastroparesis, orthostatic hypotension (autonomic neuropathy).

## 3. Macrovascular Complications

### Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia → Endothelial dysfunction, increased atherosclerosis [^1] → Narrowing of coronary arteries → Myocardial ischemia and infarction.
- **Manifestations**: Angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure.

### Cerebrovascular Disease

- **Pathophysiology**: Similar mechanism as CAD → Atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries → Ischemic strokes, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).
- **Manifestations**: Stroke symptoms, TIAs.

### Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)

- **Pathophysiology**: Atherosclerosis of peripheral arteries → Reduced blood flow to the limbs → Ischemia.
- **Manifestations**: Claudication [^2], non-healing ulcers, gangrene.

## 4. Other Complications

### Infections

- **Pathophysiology**: Hyperglycemia impairs immune function (e.g., neutrophil activity, chemotaxis) → Increased susceptibility to infections.
- **Manifestations**: Frequent infections, slow wound healing, skin infections, urinary tract infections.

### Diabetic Foot Ulcers

- **Pathophysiology**: Combination of neuropathy (loss of sensation) and PAD (poor blood flow) → Minor trauma progresses to ulcers → Risk of infection and gangrene.
- **Manifestations**: Non-healing ulcers, risk of amputation.

[^1]: **Atherosclerosis**: Thickening and hardening of the arte ries due to plaque buildup.
[^2]: **Claudication**: Pain caused by too little blood flow, typically during exercise, due to PAD.
