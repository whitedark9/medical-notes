# Diabetes Mellitus

> Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.

It leads to abnormal carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism.

## Types of Diabetes

1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells → absolute insulin deficiency.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: Insulin resistance with a relative insulin deficiency.
3. **Gestational Diabetes**: Hyperglycemia first recognized during pregnancy.
4. **Other Specific Types**: Due to specific genetic mutations, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, drug-induced, etc.

## Diagnosis

The diagnosis is based on blood glucose measurements and the presence of symptoms. There are four main criteria:

1. **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**

   - **≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)** after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours).
   - Normal fasting glucose is` <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)`.

2. **2-Hour Plasma Glucose During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**

   - **≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** 2 hours after consuming a 75 g glucose solution.
   - Normal glucose level is `<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)`.

3. **Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)**

   - **≥6.5%** indicates diabetes.
   - Normal HbA1c is `<5.7%`.

4. **Random Plasma Glucose**
   - **≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)** in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., `polyuria`, `polydipsia`, `unexplained weight loss`) or hyperglycemic crisis.

### Asymptomatic Patients

- For asymptomatic patients, the diagnosis should be confirmed by repeating the test on a different day, using the same or a different method.

### Prediabetes

Prediabetes is identified by intermediate glucose levels:

- FPG: 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L).
- 2-hour OGTT: 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L).
- HbA1c: 5.7-6.4%.

## WHO Criteria for Diagnosis

- WHO also uses the above criteria, with a strong emphasis on confirming asymptomatic cases with a second test. The fasting and 2-hour glucose values are primarily used in clinical settings.

## Diagnostic Algorithm

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - Evaluate for classic symptoms: `polyuria`, `polydipsia (Thirst)`, `polyphagia (Hunger)`, `unexplained weight loss`.
   - Perform blood glucose measurement (FPG, OGTT, or Random Plasma Glucose).

2. **Confirmatory Testing**

   - Repeat the same test on a different day if the patient is asymptomatic.
   - Alternatively, perform a different test to confirm the diagnosis.

3. **Further Evaluation**
   - If diagnosed, assess for complications (e.g., `retinopathy`, `nephropathy`, `neuropathy`).
   - Classify the type of diabetes based on clinical features and history.

## Monitoring

- **Regular Monitoring**: HbA1c every 3-6 months, daily glucose monitoring, lipid profile, renal function tests, etc.
- **Long-term Management**: Lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and monitoring for complications.
