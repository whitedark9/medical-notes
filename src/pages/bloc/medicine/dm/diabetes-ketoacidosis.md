# Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

> Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious and life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus, characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis.

**Pathophysiology**:

- **Insulin Deficiency**:
  - ↓ Insulin → ↑ Lipolysis → Free fatty acids released from adipose tissue.
- **Ketogenesis**:
  - Free fatty acids transported to the liver → Converted to ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate).
- **Metabolic Acidosis**:
  - Accumulation of ketones → Lowered blood pH (metabolic acidosis).
- **Hyperglycemia**:
  - ↓ Glucose uptake by cells → Hyperglycemia → Osmotic diuresis [^1] → Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

**Clinical Features**:

- **Symptoms**: Polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered mental status.
- **Signs**: Dehydration, Kussmaul respirations (deep, rapid breathing), fruity breath odor (due to acetone), hypotension, tachycardia.

## Management of DKA

### 1. Initial Assessment

- **History and Physical Examination**: Assess for symptoms, hydration status, mental status, and potential triggers (infection, non-compliance with insulin, etc.).
- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - **Blood Glucose**: Typically >250 mg/dL.
  - **Blood Gases**: Metabolic acidosis with a pH <7.3.
  - **Serum Ketones**: Positive (elevated ketones).
  - **Electrolytes**: Check for hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and other imbalances.
  - **BUN/Creatinine**: Assess renal function.
  - **Urinalysis**: Ketones and glucose in urine.

### 2. Immediate Treatment

- **Fluid Replacement**:
  - **0.9% Normal Saline**: Administer 1-2 liters in the first 1-2 hours, then adjust based on hemodynamic status and hydration.
  - **Monitor**: Adjust fluids as necessary, switch to 0.45% saline if corrected sodium is high, and add dextrose when blood glucose reaches ~200 mg/dL.
- **Insulin Therapy**:
  - **Intravenous (IV) Regular Insulin**: Start with a bolus of 0.1 units/kg, then a continuous infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hr.
  - **Glucose Monitoring**: Titrate insulin to lower blood glucose by 50-75 mg/dL per hour.
- **Electrolyte Management**:
  - **Potassium**: If potassium <5.3 mEq/L, add potassium to IV fluids (20-30 mEq/L). Do not start insulin if potassium is <3.3 mEq/L.
  - **Bicarbonate**: Consider if pH <6.9; administer carefully due to risks of paradoxical CNS acidosis.

### 3. Investigation to Confirm Diagnosis

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Blood glucose, electrolytes, venous blood gas every 2-4 hours.
- **Identify Precipitating Factors**: Infection, myocardial infarction, missed insulin doses, etc.

### 4. Further Management on Confirm Diagnosis

- **Transition to Subcutaneous Insulin**:
  - Once the patient is stable, anion gap is closed, and oral intake is tolerated, transition from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin.
  - Overlap IV insulin with subcutaneous insulin for 1-2 hours to prevent rebound hyperglycemia.

### 5. Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

- **Education**:
  - Importance of insulin adherence, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and recognition of early signs of DKA.
  - Plan for sick days, including adjusting insulin doses during illness.
- **Follow-Up**:
  - Regular monitoring by healthcare providers to prevent recurrence and manage underlying diabetes.
