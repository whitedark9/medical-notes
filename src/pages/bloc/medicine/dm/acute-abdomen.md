# Acute Abdomen with high RBS

> A 55 year old lady was admitted to surgical ward for acute abdomen. She was found to have RBS high and refer to medical ward. Describe the outline of management for this lady.

## Management

### 1. Initial Assessment

- **History:**

  - Duration and nature of abdominal pain, associated symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, fever)
  - Past medical history (especially diabetes)
  - Medication history

- **Physical Examination:**

  - Assess for signs of acute abdomen (e.g., guarding, rebound tenderness).
  - Check vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.
  - Evaluate for signs of diabetic complications (e.g., dehydration, altered mental status).

- **Immediate Blood Sugar Measurement:**
  - Confirm the high RBS with a repeat capillary blood glucose test.

### 2. Immediate Treatment

- **Stabilization:**
  - If the patient is hemodynamically unstable (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia), initiate resuscitation with `IV fluids`.
  - Administer `analgesics for pain control`, considering possible contraindications based on the abdominal condition.
- **Diabetes Management:**
  - **Insulin Therapy:**
    - Administer `short-acting insulin` if blood glucose is significantly elevated (>300 mg/dL) or if the patient is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
  - **Fluid Replacement:**
    - Start `IV fluids` (e.g., `normal saline`) to correct dehydration and improve renal perfusion, especially if DKA/HHS is suspected.
  - **Electrolyte Monitoring and Replacement:**
    - Monitor and `correct electrolyte imbalances` (e.g., `potassium`), which are common in DKA/HHS.

### 3. Investigation to Confirm Diagnosis

- **Blood Tests:**

  - **Blood Glucose Profile:** Fasting blood sugar (FBS), postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), HbA1c to assess the chronicity and control of diabetes.
  - **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** To assess for metabolic acidosis if DKA is suspected.
  - **Serum Electrolytes:** To monitor for abnormalities, especially potassium.
  - **Renal Function Tests:** BUN, creatinine to assess renal function, which may be impaired in hyperglycemia.
  - **Liver Function Tests:** To rule out hepatic causes of acute abdomen.

- **Imaging:**

  - **Abdominal Ultrasound or CT Scan:** To identify the cause of the acute abdomen (e.g., appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis).

- **Urine Analysis:**
  - **Urine Ketones:** To check for ketosis, which suggests DKA.
  - **Urine Culture:** If urinary tract infection (UTI) is suspected, especially if there is pyrexia or leukocytosis.

### 4. Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis

- **Acute Abdomen (e.g., Cholecystitis, Appendicitis, Pancreatitis):**

  - **Surgical Intervention:** Depending on the cause of the acute abdomen, surgical intervention may be necessary (e.g., appendectomy, cholecystectomy).
  - **Antibiotic Therapy:** Broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection is suspected.

- **Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Management:**
  - **DKA/HHS:** Continue insulin therapy with frequent glucose monitoring, IV fluids, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Monitor ABGs and correct acidosis as needed.
  - **Newly Diagnosed Diabetes:** Initiate appropriate long-term diabetes management (e.g., metformin, lifestyle changes) once acute issues are addressed.
  - **Glycemic Control:** Adjust insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents based on glucose monitoring.

### 5. Monitoring and Reassessment

- **Frequent Monitoring:**

  - Monitor vital signs, blood glucose levels, and electrolytes regularly.
  - Reassess abdominal pain and other symptoms after initial management.

- **Reevaluation:**
  - Regular reassessment of the cause of acute abdomen and the patientâ€™s response to treatment, both for the surgical and medical conditions.

### 6. Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

- **Diabetes Management:**
  - Develop a long-term diabetes management plan, including education, lifestyle modifications, and medication adjustment.
- **Post-Surgical Care:**
  - Follow up for wound care, infection prevention, and recovery after surgical intervention.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Provide advice on diet, physical activity, and routine blood glucose monitoring to prevent future complications.
