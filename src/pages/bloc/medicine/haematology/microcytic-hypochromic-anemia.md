# Microcytic Hypochromic Anemia

> A 55 year old man, farmer, came to medical OPD with giddiness, easily tiredness, loss of appetite and loss of energy for one month. His blood test showed Hb: 8 g/dl, MCV [^1]: 60 fl, MCH [^2]: 25pg, WBC: 7000/mm3, Platelet: 200x10e9/l. Discuss your differential diagnosis and investigations to get diagnosis.

[^1]: **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)**: Average volume of red blood cells. Low MCV indicates microcytic anemia.
[^2]: **MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin)**: Average amount of hemoglobin per red blood cell. Low MCH indicates hypochromic anemia.

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)

#### Pathophysiology [#IDA]

- **Chronic Blood Loss**: Most common cause in men, often due to `gastrointestinal bleeding` (e.g., `peptic ulcers`, `colorectal cancer`) or `parasitic infections`.
- **Decreased Iron Intake/Absorption**: Poor diet or malabsorption syndromes (e.g., `celiac disease`).
- **Increased Iron Demand**: Less common in this age group but may occur in chronic disease.
- **Mechanism**: Lack of iron → decreased hemoglobin synthesis → `microcytic, hypochromic anemia`.

#### Clinical Features [#IDA]

- **Symptoms**: Giddiness, fatigue, loss of appetite, and loss of energy.
- **Lab Findings**: Low hemoglobin (Hb: 8 g/dL), low MCV (60 fl), low MCH (25 pg), normal WBC, and platelets.
- Chronic GI blood loss may be suggested by his occupation as a farmer, potentially at risk for parasitic infections or heavy labor-related gastrointestinal stress.

#### Investigations [#IDA]

- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Microcytic, hypochromic red cells.
- **Iron Studies**: Low serum ferritin [^3], low serum iron, elevated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) [^4].
- **Stool Occult Blood Test**: To identify potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Endoscopy/Colonoscopy**: To identify sources of GI bleeding if occult blood is positive.

[^3]: **Ferritin**: A protein that stores iron. Low levels indicate iron deficiency; high levels can indicate anemia of chronic disease or sideroblastic anemia.
[^4]: **TIBC (Total Iron-Binding Capacity)**: Measures the blood's capacity to bind iron with transferrin. High TIBC indicates iron deficiency.

### 2. Anemia of Chronic Disease (ACD)

#### Pathophysiology [#ACD]

- **Chronic Inflammation**: Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6) increase hepcidin [^5] production → decreased iron release from macrophages and decreased iron absorption → functional iron deficiency.
- **Chronic Infections/Malignancies**: Long-standing infections or cancers can induce chronic inflammatory states leading to ACD.
- **Mechanism**: Adequate iron stores but poor utilization → mild to moderate anemia, usually `normocytic` or mildly `microcytic`.

[^5]: **Hepcidin**: Peptide hormone produced primarily by the liver, Regulates iron homeostasis of the body.

#### Clinical Features [#ACD]

- **Symptoms**: Non-specific like fatigue, loss of appetite, and general weakness, often seen in chronic conditions.
- **Lab Findings**: Mild anemia (Hb: 8 g/dL), low-normal MCV (60 fl), low MCH (25 pg), normal WBC, and platelets.
- **Occupation**: Chronic exposure to environmental antigens (e.g., dust, pesticides) may increase the risk of chronic respiratory or systemic conditions.

#### Investigations [#ACD]

- **Iron Studies**: Normal or increased serum ferritin, low serum iron, low TIBC.
- **Inflammatory Markers**: Elevated ESR [^6], CRP [^7] to suggest an ongoing inflammatory process.
- **Renal Function Tests**: To rule out renal anemia [^8] as a cause.

[^6]: **CRP (C-reactive Protein)**: Marker of inflammation. Elevated levels indicate inflammation or infection.
[^7]: **ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)**: Measures the rate at which red blood cells settle in a tube. Elevated levels indicate inflammation or chronic disease.
[^8]: **Renal anemia**: Kidneys produce erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. In CKD, the damaged kidneys produce insufficient EPO → decreased red blood cell production → **Anemia**

### 3. Thalassemia Trait (Minor)

#### Pathophysiology [#THA]

- **Genetic Mutation**: Autosomal recessive disorder affecting globin chain production → imbalanced globin chain synthesis → `microcytic, hypochromic anemia` with hemolysis.
- **Reduced Globin Synthesis**:
  - In alpha-thalassemia, deletion of alpha-globin genes
  - In beta-thalassemia, point mutations reduce beta-globin chain production.
- **Mechanism**: Excess unpaired globin chains → ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis → anemia.

#### Clinical Features [#THA]

- **Symptoms**: Often mild or asymptomatic but can present with fatigue, mild giddiness, and loss of energy.
- **Lab Findings**: Mild anemia (Hb: 8 g/dL), marked microcytosis (MCV: 60 fl), low MCH (25 pg), normal WBC, and platelets.
- **Ethnicity/Family History**: Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, or Asian ancestry may increase suspicion.

#### Investigations [#THA]

- **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis**: Elevated HbA2 or HbF levels in beta-thalassemia minor.
- **Genetic Testing**: To identify mutations in alpha or beta-globin genes.
- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Target cells and basophilic stippling may be seen.
