# Petechial Haemorrhage

> A 16 year old girl presented with petechial haemorrhage over both lowr extremities for 2 days. Discuss the differential diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. **Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**

- Autoimmune disorder leading to isolated thrombocytopenia.
- Common in children and adolescents.
- Petechiae and purpura often without systemic symptoms.

### 2. **Infectious Causes**

- **Viral Infections:**
  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV, rubella, and other viral infections can cause thrombocytopenia.
- **Bacterial Infections:**
  - Meningococcemia and other severe bacterial infections can lead to petechial rashes.

### 3. **Hematologic Disorders**

- **Leukemia:**
  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can present with petechiae due to bone marrow infiltration and thrombocytopenia.
- **Aplastic Anemia:**
  - Pancytopenia leading to petechiae, along with anemia and leukopenia.

### 4. **Coagulation Disorders**

- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):**
  - Secondary to sepsis, trauma, malignancy, or other serious conditions.
  - Characterized by widespread microthrombi and bleeding.

### 5. **Vasculitis**

- **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP):**
  - Small vessel vasculitis presenting with palpable purpura, primarily on the lower extremities, often with abdominal pain, arthritis, and renal involvement.

### 6. **Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia**

- Medications such as antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), anticonvulsants, or others can cause thrombocytopenia and resultant petechiae.

### 7. **Nutritional Deficiencies**

- **Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy):**
  - Rare but can present with petechiae, bleeding gums, and systemic symptoms of malnutrition.

### 8. **Hereditary Conditions**

- **Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome:**
  - X-linked disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent infections.

### 9. **Other Considerations**

- **Trauma or Physical Abuse:**
  - History of trauma or suspicion of non-accidental injury.

## Initial Assessment and Investigations

### History and Physical Examination

1. **Detailed History:**

   - Onset, duration, and progression of petechiae.
   - Associated symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, bone pain, or signs of systemic illness.
   - Recent infections, vaccinations, or drug use.
   - Family history of bleeding disorders or hematologic conditions.

2. **Physical Examination:**
   - Thorough skin examination to assess the distribution and extent of petechiae and any other bleeding manifestations.
   - Check for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, signs of systemic illness, or signs of vasculitis.

### Diagnostic Tests

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential:**

   - Platelet count, white blood cell count, and hemoglobin levels.
   - Peripheral blood smear to assess for abnormal cells or platelet morphology.

2. **Coagulation Profile:**

   - Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen levels, and D-dimer to evaluate for DIC or other coagulopathies.

3. **Bone Marrow Aspiration/Biopsy:**

   - If leukemia, aplastic anemia, or other bone marrow disorders are suspected.

4. **Infectious Workup:**

   - Viral serologies (EBV, CMV, HIV), blood cultures if systemic infection is suspected.

5. **Autoimmune Panel:**

   - ANA, ANCA, complement levels if vasculitis or autoimmune disease is suspected.

6. **Renal Function Tests:**

   - Urinalysis and renal function tests if Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is suspected.

7. **Nutritional Assessment:**
   - Assess for signs of malnutrition and consider vitamin C levels if scurvy is suspected.

## Management

### General Principles

1. **Identify and Treat Underlying Cause:**

   - Management should be tailored based on the identified etiology.

2. **Supportive Care:**
   - Ensure patient safety to prevent further bleeding.
   - Blood or platelet transfusions if severe thrombocytopenia or active bleeding.

### Specific Treatments

1. **ITP:**

   - Corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), or anti-D immunoglobulin.
   - Platelet transfusions in cases of severe bleeding.

2. **Infections:**

   - Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for bacterial or viral infections.
   - Supportive care for viral infections.

3. **Leukemia:**

   - Referral to a hematologist/oncologist for chemotherapy or other specific treatments.

4. **DIC:**

   - Treat underlying cause, supportive care, and possibly blood product transfusions.

5. **HSP:**

   - Supportive care with hydration and pain management.
   - Corticosteroids for severe cases with renal or gastrointestinal involvement.

6. **Nutritional Deficiencies:**

   - Vitamin C supplementation for scurvy.

7. **Drug-Induced:**
   - Discontinuation of the offending medication.

## Conclusion

- Petechial hemorrhages in a 16-year-old girl have a broad differential diagnosis that includes hematologic, infectious, autoimmune, and drug-related causes.
- A thorough history, physical examination, and targeted diagnostic testing are essential for identifying the underlying cause and guiding appropriate management.
