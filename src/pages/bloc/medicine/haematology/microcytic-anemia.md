# Microcytic Anemia, Low WBC, and Low Platelet Count

> A 25 year old woman came to medical OPD with giddiness, easily tiredness, loss of appetite and loss of energy for one month. His blood test showed Hb: 8 g/dl, MCV: 60 fl, MCH: 25pg, WBC: 2000/mm3, Platelet: 90x10e9/l. How would you manage her?

## Management of a 25-Year-Old Woman with Anemia and Pancytopenia

### 1. Initial Assessment

- **History:**

  - Duration, onset, and progression of symptoms.
  - Any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, bleeding tendencies.
  - Dietary history, menstrual history (consider menorrhagia as a cause of anemia), medication history, family history of hematological disorders.
  - Recent infections or illnesses.

- **Physical Examination:**
  - General examination: Pallor, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly.
  - Signs of bleeding: Petechiae, ecchymoses.
  - Neurological examination: To assess severity of giddiness.

### 2. Immediate Treatment

- **Stabilization:**
  - If symptomatic anemia (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia), consider blood transfusion.
  - Address immediate symptoms: Ensure hydration, rest, and dietary advice.

### 3. Investigations to Confirm Diagnosis

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC) Review:**

  - Confirm microcytic hypochromic anemia with low Hb, MCV, MCH.
  - Confirm pancytopenia (low WBC, low platelets).

- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

  - Evaluate red cell morphology (e.g., microcytes, target cells), presence of blasts, or abnormal cells.

- **Iron Studies:**

  - Serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) to assess iron deficiency.

- **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**

  - Indicated if peripheral smear suggests bone marrow failure or if pancytopenia is unexplained.
  - Evaluate for aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or infiltration by malignancy.

- **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**

  - Rule out megaloblastic anemia as a cause of pancytopenia.

- **Liver and Renal Function Tests:**
  - Assess for chronic disease that may contribute to anemia or pancytopenia.

### 4. Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis

- **Iron Deficiency Anemia:**
  - Oral iron supplements (e.g., ferrous sulfate) if no contraindications.
  - Address underlying cause (e.g., dietary deficiency, malabsorption, chronic blood loss).
- **Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (e.g., Aplastic Anemia):**
  - Hematology referral for further evaluation and management.
  - Potential treatments include immunosuppressive therapy, bone marrow transplant.

### 5. Monitoring and Reassessment

- **Follow-Up:**
  - Regular monitoring of blood counts to assess response to treatment.
  - Reevaluate symptoms and adjust management accordingly.

### 6. Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

- **Management of Underlying Cause:**
  - Treat underlying cause based on confirmed diagnosis (e.g., chronic blood loss, nutritional deficiencies).
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Dietary advice for maintaining adequate iron intake.
  - Regular follow-up to monitor blood counts and prevent recurrence.

**Footnotes:**

- **Pancytopenia:** A reduction in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets.
- **Iron Deficiency Anemia:** A condition where a lack of iron leads to a reduced number of red blood cells.
