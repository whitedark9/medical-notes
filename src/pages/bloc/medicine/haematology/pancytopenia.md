# Pancytopenia

> Pancytopenia is a medical condition characterized by a reduction in the number of all three major blood cell types:

1. **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**: Leading to `anemia`, which can cause fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath.
2. **White Blood Cells (WBCs)**: Leading to `leukopenia`, which can result in an increased risk of infections.
3. **Platelets**: Leading to `thrombocytopenia`, which can cause bleeding tendencies, bruising, and petechiae.

## Causes

- **Hematopoiesis**: Decreased production of blood cells in the bone marrow
- **Hemolysis, Leukolysis, Thrombocytolysis**: Increased destruction of blood cells in the peripheral circulation

## Questions

> A 25 year old male presented with pallor, bleeding gums and fever. Discuss the differential diagnosis.

> A 25 year old woman came to medical OPD with giddiness, easily tiredness, loss of appetite and loss of energy for one month. Her blood test showed Hb: 8 g/dl, MCV: 60 fl, MCH: 25pg, WBC: 2000/mm3, Platelet: 90x10e9/l. How would you manage her?

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. Acute Leukemia

> A rapidly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow characterized by the overproduction of immature white blood cells (blasts) that interfere with normal blood cell production.

- **Pathophysiology**: Genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells → Uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells → Accumulation of blasts in the bone marrow → Suppression of normal hematopoiesis → `Cytopenias` (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, fever, easy bruising, bleeding gums, infections, pallor.

### 2. Aplastic Anemia

> A rare and serious blood disorder where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells due to damage or suppression of hematopoietic stem cells.

- **Pathophysiology**: Bone marrow failure → `pancytopenia` (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, pallor, bleeding gums, recurrent infections, fever.

### 3. Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)

> A group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis (blood cell production) leading to dysplastic (abnormally formed) blood cells and various degrees of cytopenias, with a risk of progression to `acute myeloid leukemia (AML)`.

- **Pathophysiology**: Clonal mutations in hematopoietic stem cells → Ineffective hematopoiesis → Accumulation of dysplastic blood cells in the bone marrow → `Cytopenias` (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) in peripheral blood → Increased risk of transformation to AML
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, pallor, easy bruising, bleeding gums, infections, fever.

### 4. Sepsis

- **Pathophysiology**: Infection → systemic inflammatory response → multi-organ dysfunction → disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) → bleeding.
- **Clinical Features**: Fever, chills, rapid breathing, confusion, pallor, bleeding gums, petechiae.

### 5. Vitamin B12 Deficiency

- **Pathophysiology**: Vitamin B12 Deficiency → Impaired DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells (including hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow) → Ineffective hematopoiesis and production of abnormally large, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts) → Bone marrow suppression and apoptosis of developing blood cells → `Pancytopenia`
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, pallor, glossitis, neurologic symptoms, bleeding gums, fever (if secondary infection occurs).

### 6. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Autoantibodies (e.g., anti-RBC, anti-WBC, and anti-platelet antibodies) → Destruction of blood cells in the peripheral blood (peripheral cytopenias)
  - Immune-mediated bone marrow suppression → Impaired hematopoiesis → `pancytopenia`.
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, fever, weight loss, mucosal ulcers, arthritis, pallor, bleeding gums.

### 7. Drug-Induced Bone Marrow Suppression

- **Pathophysiology**: Certain drugs (e.g., `chemotherapy`, `antiepileptics`, `antibiotics` like `chloramphenicol`) → toxic effect on bone marrow → `pancytopenia`.
- **Clinical Features**: Fatigue, pallor, bleeding gums, infections, fever.

## Management

### 1. Initial Assessment

- **History:**

  - Duration, onset, and progression of symptoms.
  - Any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, bleeding tendencies.
  - Dietary history
  - Menstrual history (consider menorrhagia as a cause of anemia)
  - Medication history
  - Family history of hematological disorders.
  - Recent infections or illnesses.

- **Physical Examination:**
  - **General examination**: Pallor, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly.
  - **Signs of bleeding**: Petechiae, ecchymoses [^1].
  - **Neurological examination**: To assess severity of giddiness.

[^1]: **Ecchymoses**: A small bruise caused by blood leaking from broken blood vessels into the tissues of the skin or mucous membranes

### 2. Immediate Treatment

- If symptomatic anemia (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia), consider blood transfusion.
- Address immediate symptoms: Ensure hydration, rest, and dietary advice.

### 3. Investigations to Confirm Diagnosis

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC) Review:**

  - Confirm `microcytic hypochromic anemia` with low Hb, MCV, MCH.
  - Confirm `pancytopenia` (low WBC, low platelets).

- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

  - Evaluate red cell morphology (e.g., microcytes, target cells), presence of blasts, or abnormal cells.

- **Iron Studies:**

  - Serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) to assess `iron deficiency`.

- **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**

  - Indicated if peripheral smear suggests bone marrow failure or if pancytopenia is unexplained.
  - Evaluate for `aplastic anemia`, `myelodysplastic syndromes`, or infiltration by `malignancy`.

- **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**

  - Rule out `megaloblastic anemia` as a cause of pancytopenia.

- **Liver and Renal Function Tests:**
  - Assess for `chronic disease` that may contribute to anemia or pancytopenia.

### 4. Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis

- **Iron Deficiency Anemia:**
  - Oral iron supplements (e.g., ferrous sulfate) if no contraindications.
  - Address underlying cause (e.g., dietary deficiency, malabsorption, chronic blood loss).
- **Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (e.g., Aplastic Anemia):**
  - Hematology referral for further evaluation and management.
  - Potential treatments include immunosuppressive therapy, bone marrow transplant.

### 5. Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

- **Management of Underlying Cause:**
  - Treat underlying cause based on confirmed diagnosis (e.g., chronic blood loss, nutritional deficiencies).
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Regular monitoring of blood counts to assess response to treatment.
  - Reevaluate symptoms and adjust management accordingly.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Dietary advice for maintaining adequate iron intake.
  - Regular follow-up to monitor blood counts and prevent recurrence.
