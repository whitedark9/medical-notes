# Pancytopenia

> Pancytopenia is a medical condition characterized by a reduction in the number of all three major blood cell types:

1. **Red Blood Cells (RBCs)**: Leading to `anemia`, which can cause fatigue, pallor, and shortness of breath.
2. **White Blood Cells (WBCs)**: Leading to `leukopenia`, which can result in an increased risk of infections.
3. **Platelets**: Leading to `thrombocytopenia`, which can cause bleeding tendencies, bruising, and petechiae.

### Causes

- **Hematopoiesis**: Decreased production of blood cells in the bone marrow
- **Hemolysis, Leukolysis, Thrombocytolysis**: Increased destruction of blood cells in the peripheral circulation

## Question

> A 25 year old woman came to medical OPD with giddiness, easily tiredness, loss of appetite and loss of energy for one month. His blood test showed Hb: 8 g/dl, MCV: 60 fl, MCH: 25pg, WBC: 2000/mm3, Platelet: 90x10e9/l. How would you manage her?

## Management

### 1. Initial Assessment

- **History:**

  - Duration, onset, and progression of symptoms.
  - Any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, bleeding tendencies.
  - Dietary history
  - Menstrual history (consider menorrhagia as a cause of anemia)
  - Medication history
  - Family history of hematological disorders.
  - Recent infections or illnesses.

- **Physical Examination:**
  - **General examination**: Pallor, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly.
  - **Signs of bleeding**: Petechiae, ecchymoses [^1].
  - **Neurological examination**: To assess severity of giddiness.

[^1]: **Ecchymoses**: A small bruise caused by blood leaking from broken blood vessels into the tissues of the skin or mucous membranes

### 2. Immediate Treatment

- If symptomatic anemia (e.g., dyspnea, chest pain, tachycardia), consider blood transfusion.
- Address immediate symptoms: Ensure hydration, rest, and dietary advice.

### 3. Investigations to Confirm Diagnosis

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC) Review:**

  - Confirm `microcytic hypochromic anemia` with low Hb, MCV, MCH.
  - Confirm `pancytopenia` (low WBC, low platelets).

- **Peripheral Blood Smear:**

  - Evaluate red cell morphology (e.g., microcytes, target cells), presence of blasts, or abnormal cells.

- **Iron Studies:**

  - Serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) to assess `iron deficiency`.

- **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy:**

  - Indicated if peripheral smear suggests bone marrow failure or if pancytopenia is unexplained.
  - Evaluate for `aplastic anemia`, `myelodysplastic syndromes`, or infiltration by `malignancy`.

- **Vitamin B12 and Folate Levels:**

  - Rule out `megaloblastic anemia` as a cause of pancytopenia.

- **Liver and Renal Function Tests:**
  - Assess for `chronic disease` that may contribute to anemia or pancytopenia.

### 4. Further Management on Confirmed Diagnosis

- **Iron Deficiency Anemia:**
  - Oral iron supplements (e.g., ferrous sulfate) if no contraindications.
  - Address underlying cause (e.g., dietary deficiency, malabsorption, chronic blood loss).
- **Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes (e.g., Aplastic Anemia):**
  - Hematology referral for further evaluation and management.
  - Potential treatments include immunosuppressive therapy, bone marrow transplant.

### 5. Long-Term Management and Follow-Up

- **Management of Underlying Cause:**
  - Treat underlying cause based on confirmed diagnosis (e.g., chronic blood loss, nutritional deficiencies).
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Regular monitoring of blood counts to assess response to treatment.
  - Reevaluate symptoms and adjust management accordingly.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Dietary advice for maintaining adequate iron intake.
  - Regular follow-up to monitor blood counts and prevent recurrence.
