# Complications of Blood Transfusion

Blood transfusion, though life-saving, carries potential risks and complications. These complications can be categorized as acute or delayed.

1. Acute Complications (**FAT BAT**)
   - **F**ebrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)
   - **A**cute Hemolytic Reaction
   - **T**ransfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)
   - **B**acterial Contamination
   - **A**llergic Reactions
   - **T**ransfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)
2. Delayed Complications (**DIG PIC**)
   - **D**elayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR)
   - **I**ron Overload
   - **G**raft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)
   - Hyperkalemia (**P**otassium)
   - Transfusion-Transmitted **I**nfections
   - Hypocalcemia (**C**alcium)

## Acute Complications (< 24 hours)

### 1. Acute Hemolytic Reaction

- **Cause**: ABO incompatibility.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, back pain, hemoglobinuria, hypotension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Immune-mediated destruction of donor RBCs → hemolysis → release of hemoglobin (`Hemoglobinuria`) and other intracellular contents → systemic inflammatory response → `Fever`, `Chills`, `Back pain`
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~ immediately, supportive care, fluids, `diuretics` to prevent renal failure.

### 2. Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)

- **Cause**: Cytokines or leukocyte antibodies in donor blood.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills without hemolysis.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~ temporarily, `antipyretics`, restart if symptoms resolve.

### 3. Allergic Reactions

- **Cause**: Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins.
- **Symptoms**: Urticaria, itching, anaphylaxis (rare).
- **Management**: `Antihistamines`, `corticosteroids`, `epinephrine` if anaphylaxis.

### 4. Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

- **Cause**: Antibodies in donor plasma react with recipient's leukocytes.
- **Symptoms**: Acute respiratory distress, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- **Pathophysiology**: Antibodies → activation of recipient leukocytes → release of inflammatory mediators → lung injury.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~, supportive care (oxygen, mechanical ventilation if needed).

### 5. Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)

- **Cause**: Rapid transfusion or transfusion volume exceeding the circulatory capacity.
- **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, hypertension, pulmonary edema.
- **Management**: _Slow transfusion_ rate, `diuretics`, oxygen therapy.

### 6. Bacterial Contamination

- **Cause**: Contaminated blood products.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, septic shock.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~, broad-spectrum `antibiotics`, supportive care.

## Delayed Complications (> 24 hours)

### 1. Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR)

- **Cause**: Anamnestic antibody response to a previously encountered antigen.
- **Symptoms**: Mild fever, jaundice, falling hemoglobin levels.
- **Management**: Monitoring, supportive care, possible re-transfusion if anemia is severe.

### 2. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)

- **Cause**: Donor T-cells attack recipient's tissues.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, rash, liver dysfunction, pancytopenia.
- **Management**: Irradiation of blood products to prevent, supportive care.

### 3. Iron Overload

- **Cause**: Repeated transfusions, particularly in chronic transfusion-dependent patients.
- **Symptoms**: Organ dysfunction (heart, liver, pancreas).
- **Management**: Iron chelation therapy (e.g., `deferoxamine`).

### 4. Transfusion-Transmitted Infections

- **Cause**: Transmission of infectious agents (e.g., HIV, HCV, HBV).
- **Management**: Screening of blood donors, monitoring, and treatment if infection occurs.

## Other Complications

### 1. Hyperkalemia

- **Cause**: Leakage of potassium from stored RBCs.
- **Management**: Monitoring of potassium levels, correction with `calcium gluconate` [^1] or `insulin` [^2].

### 2. Hypocalcemia

- **Cause**: Citrate in transfused blood binds calcium.
- **Management**: Calcium supplementation if symptomatic.

[^1]: **Calcium gluconate** is used to stabilize the cardiac membranes (cardiac arrhythmias) affected by elevated potassium levels.
[^2]: **Insulin** helps to lower serum potassium levels by promoting the uptake of potassium into cells.
