# Petechial Haemorrhage

> A 16 year old girl presented with petechial haemorrhage over both lowr extremities for 2 days. Discuss the differential diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

### 1. Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system produces antibodies against platelets → Increased destruction of platelets in the spleen and liver → `Thrombocytopenia` [^1] → Petechiae, bruising, and bleeding.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Petechiae
  - Bruising
  - Bleeding gums
  - Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
  - Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding).

[^1]: **Thrombocytopenia**: A condition characterized by an abnormally low level of platelets (thrombocytes) in the blood. Platelets are essential for blood clotting, and their deficiency can lead to increased bleeding, bruising and petechiae.

### 2. Acute Leukemia

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Malignant transformation and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow → Marrow failure with decreased production of normal blood cells, including platelets → `Thrombocytopenia` and `dysfunctional white blood cells` → Increased bleeding and infection risk.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Fatigue [^4]
  - Pallor [^4]
  - Recurrent infections
  - Easy bruising
  - Petechiae
  - Bone pain [^2]
  - Hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) [^3].

[^2]: **Bone Pain in acute leukemia**: Due to proliferation of leukemic cell in bone marrow.
[^3]: **Extramedullary hematopoiesis**: Hematopoiesis (production of blood cells) occurring outside the bone marrow due to marrow failure → **Hepatosplenomegaly**
[^4]: Bone marrow supression → Anemia → **Fatigue & Pallor**

### 3. Viral Infections

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Certain viral infections can cause transient bone marrow suppression → Decreased platelet production → `thrombocytopenia` → petechiae.
  - Others can trigger an immune response that leads to increased platelet destruction → `thrombocytopenia` → petechiae.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Fever
  - Malaise
  - Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes)
  - Pharyngitis (sore throat)
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
  - Petechiae

### 4. Meningococcal Septicemia

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - _Neisseria meningitidis_ infects the bloodstream → a severe systemic inflammatory response → `Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)` → widespread clotting (`Thrombosis`) and subsequent bleeding occur (`Haemorhage`) → The depletion of clotting factors and platelets → Petechiae and Purpura.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Fever
  - Headache
  - Stiff neck
  - Altered mental status
  - Petechiae
  - Purpura
  - Hypotension
  - Shock

### 5. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP)

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - A small vessel vasculitis often triggered by an upper respiratory infection → Immune complex deposition in small vessels → Inflammation and vessel damage → Palpable purpura and can also affect the kidneys, joints, and gastrointestinal tract.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Palpable purpura primarily on the lower extremities and buttocks
  - Abdominal pain
  - Arthralgia (joint pain)
  - Renal involvement (hematuria, proteinuria).

### 6. Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Certain drugs can induce immune-mediated destruction of platelets or directly cause bone marrow suppression → `thrombocytopenia` → petechiae.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Recent use of drugs such as `antibiotics` (e.g., `penicillins`, `cephalosporins`), `antiepileptics`, or `heparin`
  - Petechiae
  - Bruising

### 7. Connective Tissue Disorders

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Autoimmune conditions like `systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)` can lead to vasculitis or platelet destruction.
  - Immune complexes and autoantibodies → inflammation and damage to blood vessels → bleeding and petechiae.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Rash
  - Arthralgia
  - Fatigue
  - Fever
  - Petechiae
  - other systemic manifestations.

### 8. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Deficiency or inhibition of ADAMTS13 enzyme → accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers → Increase platelet aggregation and microthrombi formation → `thrombocytopenia` and `hemolytic anemia`.
  - The microthrombi → organ dysfunction, petechiae, and purpura.
- **Clinical Features**:
  - Fever
  - Neurologic symptoms (confusion, headaches)
  - Renal dysfunction
  - Hemolytic anemia
  - Petechiae
