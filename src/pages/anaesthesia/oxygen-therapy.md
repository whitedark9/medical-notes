# Oxygen Therapy

> Administering oxygen to patients (1) to maintain adequate oxygenation, (2) improving tissue oxygenation and (3) reducing the work of breathing.

## Indications for Oxygen Therapy

1. **Hypoxemia**: PaO₂ < 60 mmHg or SpO₂ < 90%.
1. **Acute Respiratory Distress**: Conditions like `pneumonia`, `pulmonary edema`, `acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)`, `asthma` exacerbations.
1. **Chronic Respiratory Conditions**: `Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)`, `interstitial lung disease`.
1. **Cardiac Conditions**: `Heart failure`, `myocardial infarction`.
1. **Perioperative Care**: Pre- and post-surgery to ensure adequate oxygenation.
1. **Severe Trauma**: To support oxygen delivery to vital organs.
1. **Carbon Monoxide Poisoning**: To displace CO from hemoglobin and restore oxygen transport.

## Delivery Methods

1. **Nasal Cannula**: Mild hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy.
1. **Simple Face Mask**: Moderate hypoxemia, postoperative recovery.
1. **Venturi Mask**: Patients requiring specific FiO₂, COPD patients.
1. **Non-Rebreather Mask**: Severe hypoxemia, emergency situations.
1. **High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC)**: Acute respiratory failure, severe hypoxemia.
1. **Mechanical Ventilation**: Severe respiratory failure, during surgery, intensive care.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Therapy

1. **Pulse Oximetry (SpO₂)**: Non-invasive monitoring of oxygen saturation.
1. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG)**: Measures PaO₂, pCO₂, pH, HCO₃⁻ to assess oxygenation and ventilation.
1. **Clinical Assessment**: Regular monitoring of respiratory rate, effort, and mental status.

## Complications

1. **Oxygen Toxicity**: Prolonged exposure to high oxygen concentrations (>60% FiO₂) can lead to lung injury.
1. **CO₂ Retention**: In patients with chronic CO₂ retention (e.g., COPD), excessive oxygen can suppress respiratory drive.
1. **Absorption Atelectasis**: High concentrations of oxygen can lead to nitrogen washout and collapse of alveoli.
1. **Drying of Mucous Membranes**: Prolonged use of oxygen can dry out nasal passages and airways.
