# Inhalational Anaesthesia

## Properties of the Ideal Anaesthetic Agent

### Physical

- Stable compound ( unaffected by light or heat )
- Non-flammable (Does not support combustion)
- SVP high enough to allow easy vaporization and production of a clinically relevant concentration
- Inert when in contact with regularly used equipment e.g rubber, plastic, glass ,soda lime
- Cheap to manufacture
- Environmentally friendly
- Easy to administer
- Long shelf life without need for preservatives
- Non-irritant and non-pungent

### Pharmacology

- Low blood gas coefficient ( to allow rapid onset / recovery)
- High oil/gas coefficient ( Low MAC, high potency ; allows delivery with a high FiO2)
- Minimal metabolism with pulmonary excretion ( i.e unaffected by renal / hepatic impairment )
- Non-toxic, non-allergic, with no trigger for malignant hyperthermia
- No interaction with other drugs
- No teratogenic or carcinogenic

### CVS

- No cardiovascular depression
- No decrease in coronary blood flow
- No sensitization of myocardial tissue to catecholamines

### Respiratory

- No respiratory depression
- Bronchodilation

### CNS

- Analgesic properties
- Non-epileptogenic
- No increase in CBF or ICP
- No effect on cerebral autoregulation
- Muscle relaxation

### GI

- Antiemetic properties
- No effect on uterine tone

## Isoflurane

### Advantages [#Iso]

- Low Cost:cheaper than sevoflurane
- Bronchodilator
- No significant toxic metabolites
- Non-arrhythmogenic

### Disadvantages [#Iso]

- Concerns about coronary steal syndrome
- Irritant to airways

## Desoflurane

### Advantages [#Deso]

- Good for inhalational induction
- Non-irritant airways
- Faster onset/offset than isoflurane
- Non-arrhythmogenic

### Disadvantages [#Deso]

- Expensive
- Metabolised to toxic metabolites
- Formation of potentially toxic compounds on interaction with soda lime/baralyyme

## Isoflurane, Desoflurane

- All volatile agents
- May trigger malignant pyrexia in susceptible individuals
- Higher incidents of PONV compare with total intravenous anesthesia
- Possible association with post operative cognitive dysfunction
- Environmental green house gases
- Dose dependent CVS/RS depression
