# Local Anaesthesia (LA)

> Administration of anesthetic agents to a specific part of the body to block sensation, especially pain, in that localized area

- Local anesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium channels** in the neuronal membrane, preventing the initiation and propagation of **nerve impulses**.
- The effect is **reversible**, allowing normal sensation to return after the drug wears off
- e.g., Lidocaine, Bupivacaine

## Maximum Safe Dose

- Lidocaine: 3 mg/kg - 7 mg/kg (with epinephrine)
- Bupivacaine: 2 mg/kg - 3 mg/kg (with epinephrine)

## Local Anaesthetic Toxicity

- Mainly caused by the intrinsic effects of local anaesthetics in blocking conduction in all excitable tissues, particularly the CNS and heart
- The CNS is more sensitive and CNS symptoms and signs usually present first
- Include circumoral parasthesia, tongue numbness, tinnitus and blurred vision, proceeding to agitation, muscle twitching, drownsiness, respiratory depression and convulsions
- Decrease the rate of deploarization, action potential duration and refractory period in cardiac conducting tissues
- ECG: Prolongation of the PR interval and QRS duration, progressing to ventricular arrhythamias and cardiac arrest, these are more likely in the presence of acidosis or hypoxia
- Direct IV injection (especially arterial injection in the head and neck) can lead to blindness, aphasia, hemiparesis, convulsions, respiratory depression, coma or cardiac arrest
- Systemic toxicity is related to lipid solubility and potency, (e.g, bupivaciane is more toxic than lidocaine)
- Systemic toxitiy depends on the drug and mass injection, site of injection and use of vascoconstrictors
- Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions may occur with ester local anaesthesia
- Prilocaine, and less commonly benzocaine or lidocaine, may cause methaemoglobinaemia.

### Risk Factors

- Proximal injection site (e.g, intercostal, head and neck or upper limb blocks)
- Surgical use of high drug volumes for procedures such as tissue infiltration and tumescent anaesthesia
- Use of high-concentration compound local anaesthetic mixtures
- Inappropriate use of medical devices
- Administration at greater than recomended dose
