# Local Anaesthesia (LA)

> Administration of anesthetic agents to a specific part of the body to block sensation, especially pain, in that localized area

- Local anesthetics **block voltage-gated sodium channels** in the neuronal membrane, preventing the initiation and propagation of **nerve impulses**.
- The effect is **reversible**, allowing normal sensation to return after the drug wears off
- e.g., `Lidocaine`, `Bupivacaine`

## Maximum Safe Dose

- `Lidocaine`: 3 mg/kg - 7 mg/kg (with epinephrine)
- `Bupivacaine`: 2 mg/kg - 3 mg/kg (with epinephrine)

## Local Anaesthetic Toxicity

> Local Anaesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) is a life-threatening condition when LA is absorbed into the systemic circulation in excessive amounts.

- Mainly caused by the intrinsic effects of local anaesthetics in blocking conduction in all excitable tissues, particularly the CNS and CVS

### Causes

1. Excessive dosage
1. Direct IV injection
1. Rapid absorption
1. Delayed metabolism
1. Delayed excretion
1. Drug interaction
1. Increased sensitivity
1. Prolonged infusion

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

- The CNS is more sensitive, and CNS symptoms and signs are usually present first

#### Initial Symptoms

- Circumoral parasthesia (Abnormal sensation of numbness or tingling around the mouth)
- Tongue numbness
- Tinnitus (Buzzing or ringing sound)
- Blurred vision

#### Progressive Symptoms

- Agitation (Feeling nervous)
- Muscle twitching
- Drownsiness
- Respiratory depression
- Convulsions

### Cardiovascular System (CVS)

- Decrease the rate of deploarization, action potential duration and refractory period in cardiac conducting tissues

#### ECG Changes

- **Early**: Tachycardia, Hypertension
- **Intermediate**: Bradycardia, Prolong PR interval, QRS complex and QT interval
- **Severe**: Arrhythamias, Cardiac arrest (More likely in the presence of acidosis or hypoxia)

### Others

1. Direct IV injection (especially arterial injection in the head and neck)
   - Blindness
   - Aphasia (Language disorder)
   - Hemiparesis
   - Convulsions
   - Respiratory depression
   - Coma or cardiac arrest
1. **Lipid solubility and potency**: `Bupivacaine` is more toxic than `lidocaine`
1. Systemic toxitiy depends on the **drug and mass injection**, **site of injection** and **use of vascoconstrictors**
1. **Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions** may occur with `ester local anaesthesia`
1. `Prilocaine`, and less commonly `benzocaine` or `lidocaine`, may cause **methaemoglobinaemia**.

### Risk Factors

- Proximal injection site (e.g, intercostal, head and neck or upper limb blocks)
- Surgical use of high drug volumes for procedures such as tissue infiltration and tumescent anaesthesia
- Use of high-concentration compound local anaesthetic mixtures
- Inappropriate use of medical devices
- Administration at greater than recomended dose
