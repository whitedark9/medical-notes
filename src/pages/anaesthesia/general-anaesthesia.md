# General Anaesthesia (GA)

> A state of controlled unconsciousness induced by medications to perform surgery or other procedures without pain

## Triads of GA

1. Amnesia (Unconsciousness)
1. Analgesia (Pain relief)
1. Muscle relaxation

## Steps of GA

1. Induction of unconsciousness
1. Muscle relaxation
1. Intubation
1. Ventilation
1. Reversal

or

1. Induction
1. Maintanence
1. Emergence

### 1. Induction

- **Pre-operative accessment**
  - Evaluate patient's medical history, current medications, allergies, and relevant laboratory tests.
  - Identify possible interactions between patient's medications and anaesthetic drugs
  - Assess airway, breathing, circulation, and neurological status.
- **Pre-operative preparation**
  - Administer premedication (if indicated) to alleviate anxiety, induce sedation, or reduce secretions.
  - Establish intravenous access for fluid and medication administration.
- **Administer induction agents** such as propofol, etomidate, thiiopental, or ketamine via IV route
- **Assist ventilation** to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide levels
- **Secure airway** with endotracheal intubation or supraglottis airway device placement
- **Adjuvant medications**
  - `Clonidine`: Decrease post-op shivering, post-op nausea and vomiting, emergence delirium
  - `Benzodiazipine`: Decrease pre-op anxiety, mild sedation, emergence phenomenon
  - `Melatonin`: Hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic properties
  - `Antiemetic agents`: Prevent nausea and vomiting
  - `NSAIDs`: Analgesics

#### Common Induction Agents

##### Inhalation

1. `Isoflurane`
1. `Desflurane`
1. `Sevoflurane`
1. `Halothane`
1. `Nitric oxide`

##### IV injection

1. `Propofol`: GABA agonist
1. `Etomidate`: An imidazole compound that appears to depress CNS function via GABA
1. `Ketamine`: Dissociative anesthetic, NMDA receptor antagonist
1. `Thiopentone`: Rapid-onset short-acting barbiturate

#### Sequence of Induction Drugs

1. Pre-oxygenation or denitrogenation to fill lungs with 100% oxygen to permit a longer period of apnea during intubation without affecting blood oxygen levels
1. `Fentanyl` for systemic analgesia during intubation
1. `Propofol` for sedation for intubation
1. Switching from `oxygen` to `a mixture of oxygen and inhalational anaesthetic` once intubation is complete

### 2. Maintenance

- Duration of action of IV induction agents is generally 5 to 10 minutes, after which spontaneous recovery of consciousness will occur
- In order to prolong unconsciousness for the duration of surgery, anaesthesia must be maintained
- **Administer inhalational anaesthetics** (e.g., sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane) or IV infusions (e.g., propofol, volatile agents) to maintain anaesthesia depth
- **Monitor** depth of anaesthesia
- **Monitor** vital signs

#### Depths/Stages of GA

1. Induction
   - The period between the administration of induction agents and loss of consciousness
   - The patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia
1. Excitement or Delirium
   - The period following loss of consciousness and marked by excited and delirious activity
   - Respiratory and heart rate may become irregular, there may be uncontrolled movements, vomiting
1. Surgical Anaesthesia
   - The skeletal muscles relax
   - Vomiting stops
   - Hallmarks of this stage are respiratory depression and cessation of eye movements
1. Medullary Stimulation (Overdose)
   - Occurs when too much anaesthetic medication is given relative to the amount of surgical stimulation
   - Results in cessation of respiration and potential cardiovascular collapse
   - Lethal without cardiovascular and respiratory support

#### Essential Monitoring During GA

1. Continuous electrocardiography (**ECG** or EKG)
1. **Blood pressure** monitoring: Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), Invasive blood pressure (IBP) monitoring
1. Continuous pulse oximetry (**SpO2**)
1. **End-tidal carbon dioxide** monitoring
1. **Temperature** measurement
1. **Urine Output**
1. Anaesthetic agent concentration measurement (**anaesthetic machines**)
1. Peripheral nerve stimulator

### 3. Emergence

- **Discontinue anaesthetic agents** and ensure reversal of neuromuscular blockade if used
- **Begin spontaneous ventilation** or support as needed to facilitate emergence
- **Protect the airway** until the patient demonstrates adequate spontaneous breathing and airway reflexes
- May be accompanied by **temporary neurologic phenomena**: Acute mental confusion, aphasia, focal impairment in sensory or motor function
- **Post-operative care** at Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU)

#### Neuromuscular Blockade

- `Succinylcholine`, `Pancuronium`: Muscle relaxation, facilitates endotracheal intubation
- `Neostigmine`, `Sugammadex`: Reversal of neuromuscular blockade
