# Spinal Anaesthesia (SAB)

> Type of regional block in which local anaesthesia is injected into the subarachnoid space in the lumbar region, affecting lower body areas.

- Cause major conduction block which refers to blockade of major nerve routes providing surgical anaesthesia

## Types of Regional Anaesthesia

1. Neuraxial blocks (central nerve blocks)
   - Spinal (Intrathecal) :Inject into subarachnoid space
   - Epidural: Inject into epidural space
   - Caudal
1. Peripheral blocks
   - Upper limbs
   - Lower limbs
   - Trunk
1. Field blocks

## Indications

Surgeries below umbilicus

1. General
1. Urology
1. Obsteric and Gynaecology
1. Orthopaedics

Surgeries above umbilicus

- In combination with general anaesthesia or epidural

## Contraindications

### Absolute

- Lack of consent
- Infection at the site of injection
- Coagulopathy
- Severe hypovolemia
- Increase ICP

### Relative

- Uncooperative patient
- Sepsis
- Pre-existing neurological deficits
- Demyelinating lesions
- Stenotic valvular heart lesions
- Left ventricular outflow obstruction
- Severe spinal deformity

### Controversial

- Prior back surgery at the site of injection
- Complicated surgery
- Prolonged operation
- Major blood loss
- Maneuvers that compromise respiration

## Performing SAB

1. Preparation
   - Full monitoring
   - Wide-bore IV access
   - Sterile technique
1. Positioning
   - Lateral decubitus position
   - Sitting
   - Jackknife

## Drugs Used in SAB

- Only preservative free agents should be used
- Hyperberic, isoberic, hypoberic solutions such as `bupivacaine`, `levobupivacaine`, `prilocaine` and `chloroprocaine`
- Adjuvant medications
  - `Clonidine`: Decrease post-op shivering, post-op nausea and vomiting, emergence delirium
  - `Benzodiazipine`: Decrease pre-op anxiety, mild sedation, emergence phenomenon
  - `Melatonin`: Hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic properties
  - `Antiemetic agents`: Prevent nausea and vomiting
  - `NSAIDs`: Analgesics

## Complications

### Immediate

- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- High block
- Total spinal block
- Anaphylaxis
- Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST)
- Urinary retension

### Late

- Backache
- PDPD
- Cranial nerve palsy
- Meningitis
- Spinal cord or nerve root injury
- Vertebral canal haematoma
