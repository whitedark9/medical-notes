# Heart Sounds

## Systolic Heart Sound

> Systolic heart sounds include the 1st heart sound (S1) and clicks.

`S1` is a high-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `mitral and tricuspid valves` just after the beginning of systole.

## Diastolic Heart Sound

> Diastolic heart sounds include the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th heart sounds (S2, S3, and S4), as well as knocks and snaps.

`S2` is a low-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `aortic and pulmonary valves` at the beginning of diastole.

## Added Sounds

- `S3` is an abnormal heart sound in adults. When present, it occurs in early diastole, immediately after `S2`. It indicates the end of rapid ventricular filling.
- `S4` is an abnormal heart sound. When present, it occurs just before `S1` at the end of diastole.
