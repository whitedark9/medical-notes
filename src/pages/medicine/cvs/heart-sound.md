# Heart Sounds

## Systolic Heart Sound

> Systolic heart sounds include the first heart sound (S1) and clicks.

- `S1` is a high-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `mitral and tricuspid valves` just after the beginning of systole (ventricular systole).
- It is described as a `lub` sound.

## Diastolic Heart Sound

> Diastolic heart sounds include the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th heart sounds (S2, S3, and S4), as well as knocks and snaps.

- `S2` is a low-pitched sound caused by the closing of the `aortic and pulmonary valves` at the beginning of diastole (ventricular diastole).
- It is described as a `dub` sound.

## Added Sounds

- `S3` is an abnormal heart sound in adults. When present, it occurs in early diastole, immediately after `S2`. It indicates the end of rapid ventricular filling.
- `S4` is an abnormal heart sound. When present, it occurs just before `S1` at the end of diastole.

## Murmurs

> Murmur is an abnormal sound produced by turbulent blood flow within the heart.

### Types of Murmurs

#### Innocent (Physiologic) Murmurs

- Harmless
- Children and young adult
- Soft, short, systolic, often change with position or activity

#### Pathologic Murmurs

- Indicate underlying heart problems or structural abnormalities

### Classification Based on Timing

![Murmurs](/cvs/heart-sound-2.jpg)

#### Systolic Murmurs

- These occur during ventriculr systole (when the heart contracts).
- Typically heard between first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2)

1. **Ejection Murmurs**: Crescendo-decrescendo shape (Check the figure), often due to outflow obstruction (e.g. `aortic stenosis`)
1. **Pansystolic (Holosystolic) Murmurs**: Uniform intensity throughout systole, often due to regurgitation across the mitral or tricuspid valves (e.g. `mitral regurgitation`)
1. **Late Systolic Murmurs**: Start mid-to-late systole, often associated with mitral valve prolapse

#### Diastolic Murmurs

- These occur during ventricular diastole (when the heart relaxes and fills with blood)
- Typically heard after the second heart sound (S2)

1. **Early Diastolic Murmurs**: Begin immediately after S2, often due to regurgitation through the aortic or pulmonary valves (e.g. `aortic regurgitation`)
1. **Mid-Diastolic Murmurs**: Occur during mid-diastole, often due to increase flow through the mitral or tricuspid valves (e.g. `mitral stenosis`)
1. **Late Diastolic (Presystolic) Murmurs**: Occur just before S1, often due to atrial contraction pushing blood through a stenotic valve

#### Continuous Murmurs

- Occur throughout both systole and diastole
- e.g. `Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)`

### Grading of Murmurs

1. **Grade I**: Barely audible
1. **Grade II**: Soft but easily heard
1. **Grade III**: Moderately loud, without a thrill
1. **Grade IV**: Loud, with a palpable thrill
1. **Grade V**: Very loud, heard with a stethoscope lightly on the chest, palpable thrill
1. **Grade VI**: Heard without a stethoscope, palpable thrill

### Common Causes of Pathologic Murmurs

#### Valvular Heart Diseases

1. `Aortic Stenosis`: Narrowing of the aortic valve >>> Turbulent blood flow >>> Causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmurs
1. `Mitral Regurgitation`: Backflow of blood from the left ventricule into the left atrium >>> Causes a holosystolic murmur
1. `Aortic Regurgitation`: Backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle >>> Causes an early diastolic murmur
1. `Mitral Stenosis`: Narrowing of the mitral valve >>> Obstructing blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle >>> Causes a mid-to-late diastolic murmur with an opening snap

#### Congenital Heart Defects

1. `Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)`: Hole in the septum between the ventricles >>> Blood flow from left ventricle into right ventricle >>> Causes a holoscopic murmur
1. `Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)`: May cause a systolic murmur with fixed splitting of S2
1. `Patend Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)`: Causes a continuous machinery-like murmur

#### Other Cardiac Condition

1. `Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy`: Causes a systolic murmur that increases with Valsalva maneuver
1. `Infective Endocarditis`: May cause new or changing murmurs due to valvular damage
