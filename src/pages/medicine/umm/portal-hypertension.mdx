# Portal Hypertension

> A 55-year-old male who is chronic alcoholic presented to the hospital with coffee-ground
> vomiting for 4 times with passing of black tarry stool. On examination, he has marked pallor,
> jaundice, blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg and pulse rate of 120/min. Briefly discuss the
> management of this patient.

## Assessment (ABCDEF Approach)

1. **Airway**

   - Risk of aspiration due to haematemesis → Prepare suction, consider early intubation if ongoing bleeding and altered consciousness.

2. **Breathing**

   - Oxygen supplementation to maintain SpO₂ > 94%
   - Monitor RR and ABG.

3. **Circulation**

   - Large-bore IV access ×2 (14–16G)
   - Resuscitate with crystalloids first; cautious fluid use to avoid increasing portal pressure.
   - Urgent **cross-match** blood; initiate packed red cell transfusion if Hb < 7 g/dL (target 7–9 g/dL).
   - Monitor BP, HR, urine output.

4. **Disability**

   - Monitor mental status (encephalopathy risk).

5. **Exposure**

   - Look for signs of chronic liver disease (spider naevi, ascites, palmar erythema).

6. **Focused history**

   - Alcohol use, previous GI bleeding, known liver disease, medications (NSAIDs, anticoagulants).

## Immediate Medical Management

1. **Suspected variceal haemorrhage** (portal hypertension, cirrhosis, coffee-ground vomiting, melena, hypotension)

   - `IV Terlipressin`: 2 mg every 4–6 hrs (max 72 hrs)
     → Reduces portal venous pressure
   - `IV Antibiotic prophylaxis`: `Ceftriaxone` 1 g daily for 5–7 days
     → Reduces risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and mortality.

2. **Resuscitation goals**

   - Target MAP > 65 mmHg, Hb 7–9 g/dL
   - Avoid over-transfusion → may increase portal hypertension and rebleeding risk.

3. **Urgent Upper GI Endoscopy** (within 12 hrs after stabilization)

   - If **varices present**:

     - `Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL)` — first-line
     - `Sclerotherapy` — if banding not feasible

   - If **no varices**: Stop `terlipressin` → treat as non-variceal bleed (e.g. PPI infusion).

4. **If bleeding not controlled**

   - Repeat endoscopic therapy **OR**
   - `Balloon tamponade` (temporary, high complication risk) **OR**
   - `Emergency TIPSS` (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt).

## Post-Haemostasis Care

- **Continue `terlipressin`** to 72 hrs post-control
- **Start `non-selective β-blocker`** (e.g. `propranolol`) as secondary prophylaxis once stable
- **Endoscopic eradication programme**: Repeat banding every 2–4 weeks until varices obliterated
- **Monitor for complications**: Hepatorenal syndrome, encephalopathy, infection.

## Surgical

- **Surgery is last resort** — high mortality in cirrhotic patients
- **Indications**: Failed medical + endoscopic + TIPSS
- **Options**:

  1. **Shunt procedures** (portocaval, mesocaval, splenorenal) — now rarely first-line due to TIPSS availability.
  2. **Devascularisation procedures** (Sugiura operation) — ligation of oesophageal and gastric varices.
