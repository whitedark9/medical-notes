# Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

> What are the common causes of acute renal failure in Myanmar? A 60-year-old lady
> presenting with fever and loose motions several times. She had underlying diabetes and
> hypertension; her urine output was reduced. How would you manage this patient?

## Common Causes of AKI

### Pre-renal

- Impaired perfusion:
  - Cardiac failure
  - Sepsis
  - Blood loss
  - Dehydration
  - Vascular occlusion

### Renal

- Glomerulonephritis
- Small-vessel vasculitis
- Acute tubular necrosis
  - Drugs
  - Toxins
  - Prolonged hypotension
- Interstitial nephritis
  - Drugs
  - Toxins
  - Inflammatory disease
  - Infection, including COVID-19

### Post-renal

- Urinary calculi (bilateral)
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis
- Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)
- Bladder cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Cervical cancer
- Urethral stricture/valves
- Meatal stenosis/phimosis

## Diagnosis

> Acute Gastroenteritis with Possible Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury in a Patient with Diabetes & Hypertension

### Points for Diagnosis

- Fever → systemic inflammatory response (infection).
- Loose motions → GI fluid loss.
- Reduced urine output → dehydration or AKI.
- DM & HTN → higher risk of severe infection, rapid deterioration, and electrolyte disturbances.

## Assessment – Medical Approach

### 1. Immediate ABCDE

- **A**: Airway patent.
- **B**: O₂ if SpO₂ \<94%.
- **C**:

  - Check BP, HR → hypotension = shock.
  - IV access × 2 (large bore).
  - Start resuscitation if hypotensive.

- **D**: Check GCS (electrolyte imbalance, sepsis).
- **E**: Full exposure → look for dehydration signs (skin turgor, mucous membranes).

### 2. Focused History

- Duration, volume, and character of diarrhoea (watery/bloody).
- Associated vomiting, abdominal pain.
- Recent travel, antibiotic use, sick contacts.
- Comorbidities, drug history (esp. ACE inhibitors, diuretics, metformin).
- Fluid intake and urine output.

### 3. Physical Examination

- General: dehydration, septic appearance.
- Vitals: fever, hypotension, tachycardia.
- Abdominal exam: tenderness, guarding (exclude surgical cause).
- Neurological: confusion (electrolytes/sepsis).

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- Stool routine, culture & sensitivity → identify pathogen.
- Stool microscopy (ova, cysts, parasites).

### For Cause/Severity

- FBC: leukocytosis (infection), Hb.
- CRP/ESR: inflammatory marker.
- U\&E, creatinine: AKI assessment.
- Serum glucose: hyperglycaemia from stress/poor diabetic control.
- Blood cultures: if sepsis suspected.
- Electrolytes: Na⁺, K⁺, bicarbonate.

### For Complications

- Urinalysis (proteinuria, infection).
- ECG (if electrolyte disturbance suspected).

## Management

### 1. Resuscitation & Support

- If shock: `Isotonic fluid bolus` (0.9% NaCl, 500–1000 mL over 15–30 min), reassess.
- Aim `urine output` ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr (insert urinary catheter for monitoring).
- `Oxygen` if hypoxic.

### 2. Fluid & Electrolyte Replacement

- Correct dehydration according to severity (mild/moderate/severe).
- Oral rehydration solution if able to drink; IV fluids if unable.
- Replace K⁺ if low (after confirming renal function)
- If _K+ > 6.5 mmol/L and ECG changes of hyperkalaemia_:
  - `Calcium gluconate` to stablise myocardium,
  - `Oral potassium exchange resin` to prevent K+ absorption **or** `IV glucose/insulin or Sodium bicarbonate` to move K+ intracelluarly

### 3. Glycaemic Control

- Withhold `metformin` during AKI/sepsis (risk of lactic acidosis).
- Use `insulin` sliding scale; monitor capillary glucose frequently.

### 4. Antibiotics

- Most acute watery diarrhoea is viral and self-limiting → antibiotics not routine.
- Indicated if:

  - Suspected bacterial dysentery (bloody diarrhoea, fever).
  - Severe illness or sepsis.
  - Immunocompromised (diabetes qualifies in severe case).

- Empirical: e.g., `ciprofloxacin` or `azithromycin` (adjust per local guidelines & C\&S results).

### 5. Treat Underlying Cause

- Stop nephrotoxic drugs (`NSAIDs`, `aminoglycosides`, `ACE inhibitors`).
- Control hypertension but avoid excessive BP drop (risk of renal hypoperfusion).

### 6. Monitor

- Vitals, urine output, fluid balance chart.
- Renal function daily until recovery.
