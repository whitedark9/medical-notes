# Diabetes Ketoacidosis (DKA)

> A 16-year-old man with known diabetes mellitus was brought to the hospital for
> breathlessness and fever. He missed his insulin injection for 3 doses because he could not
> eat well and had nausea and vomiting. On examination, he is dehydrated and hypotensive.
> How would you assess and manage him?

## Assessment

### 1. Rapid Initial Assessment — ABCDEF

- **A – Airway**

  - Ensure patency; protect if reduced consciousness (GCS ≤ 8)

- **B – Breathing**

  - Observe rate & pattern: **Kussmaul respiration** (deep, labored) suggests metabolic acidosis
  - Oxygen saturation: give O₂ if SpO₂ < 94%

- **C – Circulation**

  - Pulse rate: tachycardia expected from dehydration & stress
  - BP: hypotension from volume depletion
  - Capillary refill & peripheral temperature
  - Check for shock signs

- **D – Disability**

  - GCS, pupillary reaction, confusion/coma risk from severe acidosis or cerebral oedema
  - Blood glucose measurement immediately

- **E – Exposure**

  - Full examination for infection (skin, chest, urinary tract)

- **F – Fluid status**

  - Assess dehydration (dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes, poor skin turgor, collapsed JVP)

### 2. Focused History

- **Presenting complaints**: breathlessness, fever, polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss
- **Duration**: missed insulin × 3 doses (precipitating factor)
- **Past history**: type 1 diabetes, insulin regimen, prior DKA episodes
- **Possible triggers**:

  - Infection (respiratory, urinary) — commonest
  - Stress events (surgery, trauma)
  - Myocardial infarction, pancreatitis

- **Drug history**: SGLT2 inhibitors, steroids
- **Allergies**

### 3. Physical Examination

- **General**: ill-looking, dehydrated, hypotensive
- **Respiratory**: tachypnoea, Kussmaul’s breathing, smell of acetone
- **Cardiovascular**: tachycardia, weak pulse
- **Neurological**: altered consciousness, drowsiness
- **Infection focus**: chest crepitations, CVA tenderness, cellulitis

### 4. Investigations

**For diagnosis of DKA**

- **Blood glucose**: > 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL)
- **Blood ketones**: ≥ 3 mmol/L (or urine ketones ≥ 2+)
- **Venous blood gas**: pH < 7.3 and/or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L

**For cause**

- FBC, CRP
- Blood cultures, urine analysis & culture
- Chest X-ray
- ECG (to detect MI, K⁺ disturbances)

**For complications**

- U\&E: Na⁺ (low), K⁺ (high initially, low later), urea (high from dehydration)
- Serum osmolality (risk of cerebral oedema if corrected too fast)
- Pregnancy test in women of reproductive age

## Management

> **Treat in hospital immediately — DKA is a medical emergency**
> Adapted from _Davidson’s Principles & Practice of Medicine, 24th ed._

### 1. Immediate Priorities — ABCDEF

1. **Airway**: Maintain patency, consider airway protection if reduced GCS
2. **Breathing**: O₂ if SpO₂ < 94% (avoid hyperoxia)
3. **Circulation**:

   - If **SBP < 90 mmHg**: Give **500 mL 0.9% saline** over 10–15 min, repeat until SBP ≥ 90 mmHg

4. **Disability**: Hourly neuro checks (risk of cerebral oedema)
5. **Exposure**: Look for infection foci, check temperature
6. **Fluids**: Start resuscitation immediately

### 2. Specific DKA Management

#### A. Fluid replacement

- Corrects dehydration, improves perfusion, lowers glucose & ketones
- **If SBP ≥ 90 mmHg**:

  - 1 L `0.9% saline` over 1 hr
  - Then 1 L over 2 hrs
  - Then 1 L over 4 hrs
  - Adjust for age, cardiac/renal status
  - Targeted urine output ≥ 0.5 ml/kg/hr

- When glucose < 14 mmol/L → add `10% glucose at 125 mL/hr` to prevent hypoglycaemia while continuing insulin

#### B. Insulin therapy

- Start `fixed-rate insulin infusion`: 0.1 units/kg/hr (e.g. 6–8 units/hr in average adult)
- Continue `basal SC insulin` if patient was on it before
- Goal: fall in ketones ≥ 0.5 mmol/L/hr, glucose drop ≥ 3 mmol/L/hr

#### C. Potassium replacement

- DKA causes **total body K⁺ depletion** despite initial hyperkalaemia
- **If K⁺ > 5.5 mmol/L** → no `KCl` in fluids
- **If K⁺ 3.5–5.5 mmol/L** → add 40 mmol `KCl` per L of fluid
- **If K⁺ < 3.5 mmol/L** → give K⁺ before insulin

#### D. Treat precipitating cause

- **Infection**: start `empiric antibiotics` after cultures
- **Missed insulin**: address cause, educate on sick-day rules
- **Other causes**: MI, pancreatitis, trauma

#### E. Monitoring

- Hourly: blood glucose, ketones, vital signs
- 2–4 hourly: electrolytes, venous blood gas
- Strict fluid balance, urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr

### 3. Resolution Criteria

- Blood ketones ≤ 0.6 mmol/L
- Venous pH > 7.3
- Bicarbonate > 15 mmol/L
- Patient clinically well and tolerating oral intake

### 4. Transition to SC Insulin

- Give SC short-acting insulin with first meal
- Continue IV insulin for **30 min after** SC insulin to prevent rebound hyperglycaemia
- Resume full insulin regimen

### 5. Patient Education & Prevention

- Sick-day rules: never omit insulin, monitor glucose & ketones more frequently
- Adequate hydration during illness
- Early medical contact if unable to eat or persistent vomiting
