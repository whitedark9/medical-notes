# Alcohol withdrawal syndrome

> A set of symptoms occurring after abrupt cessation or reduction of heavy and prolonged alcohol intake due to central nervous system hyperexcitability from loss of alcohol’s depressant effect.

## Causes / Risk factors

- Chronic heavy alcohol consumption
- Previous withdrawal episodes
- Concurrent illness (infection, liver disease)
- Poor nutrition, electrolyte imbalance
- Abrupt cessation without medical supervision

## Pathophysiology

Chronic alcohol use → ↑ GABAergic activity (inhibitory) and ↓ glutamatergic activity (excitatory) → neuroadaptation over time
Cessation of alcohol → sudden ↓ GABA effect + rebound ↑ glutamate activity → CNS hyperexcitability → tremors, seizures, delirium tremens

## Clinical features

**Onset:** 6–24 hrs after last drink (varies by severity)

1. Minor withdrawal (6–12 hrs)

   - Tremors, anxiety, insomnia, diaphoresis, palpitations, GI upset

2. Alcoholic hallucinosis (12–24 hrs)

   - Visual/auditory/tactile hallucinations, clear sensorium

3. Withdrawal seizures (12–48 hrs)

   - Generalised tonic-clonic seizures

4. Delirium tremens (48–96 hrs)

   - Confusion, agitation, hallucinations, fever, severe autonomic hyperactivity (↑ BP, ↑ HR), dehydration

## Investigations

For diagnosis:

- Clinical diagnosis based on history of alcohol dependence + symptom timing
- CIWA-Ar (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised) score

For causes / complications:

- CBC (infection, anaemia)
- LFT (alcoholic hepatitis, liver failure)
- Electrolytes (↓ Mg, ↓ K, ↓ PO₄)
- Blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)
- Renal function tests (dehydration)
- Blood alcohol level (if needed)

## Management (ABCDEF approach)

**Airway, breathing, circulation:**

- Ensure airway patency, oxygen if hypoxic, IV access, monitor vitals

**Disability (neurological status):**

- Monitor for seizures, GCS

**Exposure:**

- Look for injuries, signs of infection, dehydration

**Fluid & electrolyte correction:**

- `IV fluids`, correct Mg²⁺, K⁺, PO₄ abnormalities

**Drugs:**

- `Benzodiazepines` (`diazepam`, `lorazepam`) → first-line to prevent progression & seizures

  - Symptom-triggered or fixed-dose regimen based on CIWA-Ar score

- `Thiamine 100 mg IV` before glucose to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy
- `Multivitamins`, `folic acid`

**F (further care & follow-up):**

- Treat coexisting medical problems
- Monitor in hospital for high-risk patients (previous DTs, severe comorbidities)
- Long-term alcohol cessation programme, counselling, support groups
