# Cerebral Malaria

> A severe neurological complication of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria characterized by **unrousable coma >30 minutes after seizure or correction of hypoglycemia, with parasitemia and no other cause of encephalopathy**.

## Clinical Features

### General

- High-grade fever with chills
- Severe headache
- Vomiting

### Neurological

- Altered consciousness → drowsiness → coma
- Generalized seizures (common in children)
- Delirium, agitation, hallucinations
- Focal neurological deficits (rare)
- Signs of raised intracranial pressure (decerebrate/decorticate posturing, abnormal respiration)
- Meningism (may mimic meningitis)

### Systemic

- Jaundice
- Pallor (anaemia)
- Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly
- Features of multi-organ involvement (renal failure, ARDS, shock, DIC)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- Peripheral blood smear (thick and thin film) → _P. falciparum_ parasites
- Rapid diagnostic tests (HRP-2, LDH antigen detection)

### For Exclusion of Other Causes of Encephalopathy

- Blood glucose → exclude hypoglycemia
- Lumbar puncture → to exclude meningitis/encephalitis (if no raised ICP)

### For Severity/Complications

- CBC → anemia, thrombocytopenia
- Renal function (urea, creatinine)
- LFTs (bilirubin, enzymes)
- Electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, bicarbonate)
- ABG (metabolic acidosis)
- Chest X-ray (pulmonary edema/ARDS)
- Coagulation profile (DIC)

## Diagnosis

> Cerebral malaria is diagnosed by **coma + falciparum parasitemia + exclusion of other causes**, with features of **severe systemic involvement**.

## Management

### Emergency Management

#### A – Airway

- Ensure airway patency.
- Intubate if GCS < 8 or recurrent seizures.

#### B – Breathing

- Oxygen therapy to maintain SpO₂ > 94%.
- Mechanical ventilation if respiratory failure/ARDS.

#### C – Circulation

- IV access, cardiac monitoring, BP monitoring.
- Avoid fluid overload (risk of pulmonary edema).
- Correct hypovolemia cautiously with isotonic saline.

#### D – Disability

- Monitor GCS hourly.
- Treat seizures (IV diazepam/lorazepam, then phenytoin if recurrent).
- Correct hypoglycemia: 25–50 ml 50% dextrose IV bolus, then 10% dextrose infusion.

#### E – Exposure

- Temperature control (antipyretics, tepid sponging).
- Search for and treat concurrent infections.

### Specific Antimalarial Treatment

#### First-line (WHO, 2022)

- `IV Artesunate`

  - 2.4 mg/kg IV at 0 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, then once daily until oral therapy possible.
  - Switch to oral ACT (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy) as soon as patient can tolerate orally.

#### Alternative (if artesunate not available)

- `IV Quinine dihydrochloride`

  - Loading: 20 mg/kg IV infusion over 4 hours (max 1.4 g)
  - Maintenance: 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, each over 4 hours
  - Reduce dose if therapy >48 hrs or renal impairment
  - Monitor for hypoglycemia and arrhythmias.

### Supportive and Adjunctive Measures

- **Fluids:** Balanced → avoid both dehydration & overload.
- **Antipyretics:** `Paracetamol`.
- **Seizures:** `Benzodiazepines` → `phenytoin` if recurrent.
- **Hypoglycemia:** Regular monitoring and correction.
- **Electrolyte balance:** Correct Na⁺, K⁺, acidosis.
- **Renal support:** Dialysis if acute kidney injury.
- **Blood transfusion:** If severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL).
- ~~Avoid `corticosteroids`, `mannitol`, or `heparin`~~ (not beneficial, harmful).

### Monitoring

- Vital signs (pulse, BP, RR, SpO₂, temperature)
- Neurological status (GCS, pupils)
- Blood glucose (every 4–6 hrs)
- Urine output (catheterized patient; aim >0.5 ml/kg/hr)
- Parasite density (daily blood film until negative)
- Renal and liver function, electrolytes daily

### Prevention of Recurrence

- Complete oral ACT after IV course (e.g., `artesunate` + `lumefantrine`).
- Avoid `mefloquine` immediately after `artesunate` (risk of neurotoxicity).
- Vector control, insecticide-treated bed nets.
- Chemoprophylaxis in endemic areas (for travelers).
