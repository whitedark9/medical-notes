# Rabies

> Rabies is an **acute, progressive viral encephalomyelitis** caused by the **rabies virus** (a lyssavirus), transmitted mainly via the **bite of an infected animal** (usually dogs). It is **almost always fatal once symptoms appear**.

## Etiology & Transmission

- **Virus:** _Rabies_ virus (Lyssavirus)
- **Reservoirs:** Dogs, bats, foxes, raccoons, monkeys
- **Transmission:**

  - Bite or scratch from infected animal
  - Contamination of broken skin or mucous membranes with saliva
  - Rare: organ transplantation from infected donor

## Pathophysiology

- Virus inoculated into muscle → binds to **nicotinic acetylcholine receptors** → travels via **peripheral nerves to CNS** → brain infection → encephalomyelitis → spread to salivary glands and other organs.

## Clinical Features

### Incubation Period:

- Usually **1–3 months** (range: days to 1 year), depends on bite site and viral load

### Prodromal Phase (2–10 days):

- Fever, malaise, headache, myalgia
- Paraesthesia, tingling, or pain at bite site
- Nausea, vomiting, anxiety

### Furious (Encephalitic) Rabies (80% cases):

- Hyperactivity, agitation, hallucinations
- Hydrophobia (fear of water)
- Aerophobia (fear of drafts or air)
- Spasms, autonomic dysfunction (salivation, sweating, tachycardia)
- Seizures

### Paralytic (Dumb) Rabies (20% cases):

- Flaccid paralysis starting at bite site
- Gradual ascending paralysis
- Less prominent CNS symptoms

### Terminal Stage:

- Coma → respiratory failure → death (usually within 7–10 days of symptom onset)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis (usually post-mortem, but some ante-mortem tests exist):

- **Saliva:** RT-PCR for viral RNA
- **Serum & CSF:** Rabies virus-specific antibodies (IgM, IgG)
- **Skin biopsy (nape of neck):** Immunofluorescence for viral antigen in hair follicles
- **CSF:** Lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein

### Diagnosis

- Diagnosis is **primarily clinical** in endemic areas; post-exposure prophylaxis should not be delayed for lab confirmation.

## Management

### 1. **Prevention (Primary & Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)**

#### Wound Care:

- Immediate and thorough **washing with soap and running water for 15 min**
- Apply **antiseptic** (povidone-iodine)

#### Vaccination (WHO schedule):

- **Cell culture or purified Vero cell vaccines** (human diploid cell vaccine, HDCV)
- **Intradermal or intramuscular regimens** depending on availability

#### Rabies Immunoglobulin (RIG):

- **For category III exposure** (transdermal bite/scratch)
- Dose: 20 IU/kg (human RIG)
- Infiltrate into and around the wound, remainder IM

### 2. **Symptomatic Treatment (once symptoms develop)**

- Supportive care in ICU (hydration, nutrition, sedation, seizure control)
- No effective antiviral treatment; mortality is >99%

## Prognosis

- **Almost universally fatal** after clinical onset
- Early post-exposure prophylaxis is **highly effective** (>99%)

## Key Points for Exam

- Furious rabies → hydrophobia, aerophobia, hyperactivity
- Paralytic rabies → ascending paralysis, less CNS signs
- Post-exposure prophylaxis **prevents disease**
- Clinical diagnosis is sufficient; do not wait for labs
