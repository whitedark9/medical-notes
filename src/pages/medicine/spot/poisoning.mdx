# Poisoning

## Classification

1. **According to source**

   - Pharmaceutical drugs (overdose, adverse reaction)
   - Household agents (detergents, kerosene, phenol)
   - Agricultural chemicals (pesticides, insecticides, rodenticides)
   - Industrial poisons (heavy metals, gases)
   - Plant and animal toxins (mushrooms, snake venom)

2. **According to intention**

   - Accidental
   - Suicidal
   - Homicidal
   - Occupational

## Clinical Features

- Depend on type of poison, dose, and route of exposure
- **General manifestations:**

  - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
  - Altered consciousness (drowsy, coma, seizures)
  - Respiratory distress
  - Cardiovascular instability (shock, arrhythmia)
  - Pupillary changes (pinpoint in opioids, dilated in anticholinergics)
  - Odor (e.g., bitter almond in cyanide, garlic in organophosphates)

## General Principles of Management (ABCDE)

- **A:** Airway – ensure patency, intubation if needed
- **B:** Breathing – oxygen, ventilation support
- **C:** Circulation – IV access, fluids, vasopressors if shock
- **D:** Disability – assess GCS, treat seizures, check glucose
- **E:** Exposure – decontamination (remove clothes, wash skin)

## Specific Measures

- **Gastrointestinal decontamination:**

  - `Activated charcoal` (most poisons within 1 hr)
  - `Gastric lavage` (selected cases, early presentation, not for corrosives/hydrocarbons)

- **Antidotes (examples):**

  - `Naloxone` → opioids
  - `Atropine` + `pralidoxime` → organophosphates
  - `N-acetylcysteine` → paracetamol
  - `Hydroxocobalamin` / `sodium thiosulphate` → cyanide

- **Enhanced elimination:** Forced diuresis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion (for dialyzable toxins).

## Prevention

- Safe storage and labeling of chemicals and drugs
- Education and awareness
- Occupational safety measures
- Mental health support to prevent suicidal ingestion
