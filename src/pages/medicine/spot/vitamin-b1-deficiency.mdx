# Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Deficiency

## Causes

- Chronic alcoholism (most common in adults)
- Poor diet (polished rice, malnutrition)
- Increased requirement (pregnancy, lactation, hyperthyroidism, infections)
- Prolonged parenteral nutrition without supplementation
- Dialysis

## Clinical Features

### 1. **Beriberi**

- **Dry Beriberi (neurological):**

  - Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, paresthesia)
  - Muscle weakness, wasting
  - Foot drop, wrist drop

- **Wet Beriberi (cardiac):**

  - High-output cardiac failure
  - Dilated cardiomyopathy
  - Edema

### 2. **Wernicke’s Encephalopathy**

- Confusion
- Ophthalmoplegia / nystagmus
- Ataxia

### 3. **Korsakoff’s Psychosis**

- Amnesia, confabulation, psychosis (usually chronic alcoholics after Wernicke’s)

## Investigations

- Clinical diagnosis is primary.
- Erythrocyte transketolase activity (low).
- Blood/urine thiamine levels.
- MRI brain (Wernicke’s lesions in mammillary bodies, thalamus).

## Management

- **Thiamine replacement:**

  - `IV thiamine 100 mg` before glucose (to prevent Wernicke’s in alcoholics).
  - Oral supplementation 10–50 mg/day for maintenance.

- **Treat underlying cause:** alcohol abstinence, improved nutrition.
