# Differential Diagnosis of Fever + Anaemia + Bleeding

## 1. **Acute Leukaemia**

**Why & How:**

- Malignant proliferation of immature blasts in bone marrow → suppression of normal hematopoiesis → anemia + thrombocytopenia → bleeding.
- Neutropenia → infections → fever.

**Other Clinical Features:**

- Pallor, fatigue, lymphadenopathy
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Gum hypertrophy, bone pain (esp. ALL)
- Petechiae, ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding

**Investigations:**

- CBC → anemia, thrombocytopenia, WBC high/low with blasts
- Peripheral smear → blasts
- Bone marrow aspiration → >20% blasts (diagnostic)
- Immunophenotyping, cytogenetics

**Management:**

- Stabilize: blood transfusion (PRBC, platelets), antibiotics for infection
- Definitive: multi-agent chemotherapy (e.g., “3+7” regimen for AML)
- Targeted therapy (TKIs for Ph+ ALL/AML)
- Stem cell transplantation in eligible cases

## 2. **Aplastic Anaemia**

**Why & How:**

- Bone marrow aplasia → pancytopenia.
- Anemia → pallor, fatigue
- Thrombocytopenia → bleeding
- Neutropenia → infections + fever

**Other Clinical Features:**

- No organomegaly (distinguishes from leukemia/kala-azar)
- Recurrent infections, mucosal bleeding, petechiae
- Chronic course

**Investigations:**

- CBC → pancytopenia
- Reticulocyte count → very low
- Bone marrow aspiration → hypocellular marrow
- Exclude secondary causes (drugs, hepatitis, toxins, viral infections)

**Management:**

- Supportive → transfusions, antibiotics
- Definitive →

  - Immunosuppressive therapy (ATG + cyclosporine)
  - Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (young fit patients)

## 3. **Kala-Azar (Visceral Leishmaniasis)**

**Why & How:**

- _Leishmania donovani_ infection → infiltration of bone marrow → pancytopenia.
- Anaemia from marrow suppression + hypersplenism.
- Thrombocytopenia → bleeding.
- Infection itself → fever.

**Other Clinical Features:**

- Prolonged irregular fever
- Massive splenomegaly, hepatomegaly
- Weight loss, dark skin (“kala-azar”)
- Weakness, recurrent infections

**Investigations:**

- CBC → pancytopenia
- rK39 rapid test / ELISA (serology)
- Bone marrow / splenic aspirate → amastigotes
- PCR (confirmatory in reference centres)

**Management:**

- First-line: Liposomal amphotericin B
- Alternatives: Miltefosine, Amphotericin B deoxycholate
- Supportive: transfusions, antibiotics, nutrition

## 4. **Septicemia with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**

**Why & How:**

- Severe sepsis → activation of coagulation cascade → microthrombi + consumption of clotting factors/platelets → bleeding.
- Anaemia due to hemolysis, blood loss.
- Fever due to infection.

**Other Clinical Features:**

- Bleeding from venipuncture sites, mucosal bleeding, petechiae, ecchymoses
- Hypotension, tachycardia (shock)
- Organ dysfunction (renal, hepatic, CNS, respiratory)

**Investigations:**

- CBC → thrombocytopenia, anemia
- Coagulation: ↑ PT, ↑ aPTT, ↓ fibrinogen, ↑ D-dimer
- Blood culture (source of sepsis)

**Management:**

- Treat underlying infection (broad-spectrum IV antibiotics)
- Supportive: fluids, vasopressors if shock
- Replace coagulation factors (FFP, cryoprecipitate, platelets)
- Heparin in chronic DIC (select cases)

## 5. **Severe Malaria (Falciparum)**

**Why & How:**

- _Plasmodium falciparum_ → RBC destruction → anaemia
- Platelet destruction + DIC → bleeding
- Parasitemia → high-grade fever

**Other Clinical Features:**

- Intermittent fever with chills
- Jaundice, splenomegaly
- Cerebral malaria (seizures, coma)
- Renal failure, acidosis, hypoglycemia in severe disease

**Investigations:**

- Peripheral smear (thick & thin) → parasites
- Rapid antigen test (HRP2/LDH)
- CBC → anemia, thrombocytopenia
- Renal/liver function tests (complications)

**Management:**

- IV Artesunate (first-line for severe malaria)
- Switch to oral ACT when tolerated
- Supportive → blood transfusion, fluids, dialysis if AKI
- Avoid quinine unless artesunate unavailable

2. **Aplastic anemia** (marrow failure, pancytopenia)
3. **Kala-azar** (marrow suppression, hypersplenism)
4. **Septicemia with DIC** (consumption coagulopathy)
5. **Severe falciparum malaria** (hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, DIC)
