# Leptospirosis

> Leptospirosis is a **zoonotic bacterial infection** caused by **Leptospira interrogans**, transmitted to humans via **contact with water or soil contaminated by urine of infected animals**.

## Etiology & Transmission

- **Causative organism:** _Leptospira interrogans_ (spirochete)
- **Reservoirs:** Rodents, cattle, pigs, dogs
- **Transmission:**

  - Contact of broken skin or mucous membranes with contaminated water, soil, or animal urine
  - Occupational exposure (farmers, sewer workers)
  - Recreational exposure (floods, swimming in contaminated water)

## Pathophysiology

- Entry → bloodstream → dissemination → endothelial damage → **vasculitis**
- Multi-organ involvement: **liver, kidney, lungs, CNS**
- Immune-mediated tissue injury in second phase

## Clinical Features

### Incubation:

- 2–30 days (average 7–14 days)

### Phases:

1. **Septicemic / Anicteric Phase (first 5–7 days)**

- Fever, chills, headache, myalgia (calf and lumbar muscles)
- Conjunctival suffusion (classic sign)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

2. **Immune / Icteric Phase (Weil’s Disease)**

- Jaundice (mild to severe)
- Oliguric or non-oliguric **acute kidney injury**
- Hemorrhagic manifestations (petechiae, ecchymoses, GI bleed)
- Pulmonary involvement: cough, hemoptysis, ARDS
- Meningitis/encephalitis (rare)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis:

- **Serology:**

  - Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) – gold standard
  - ELISA IgM (early diagnosis)

- **PCR:** Detection of Leptospira DNA in blood (first week) or urine (after 1 week)
- **Culture:** Rarely used, slow growth

### For Complications:

- CBC → leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia
- LFTs → elevated bilirubin, transaminases
- Renal function → creatinine, urea (AKI)
- Urinalysis → proteinuria, hematuria

## Management

### 1. Supportive:

- Maintain hydration
- Monitor renal and hepatic function
- Oxygen / mechanical ventilation if pulmonary involvement

### 2. Antibiotic Therapy:

- **Mild disease:** Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days
- **Severe disease (Weil’s):**

  - IV Penicillin G 1.5 million units every 6 hours for 7 days
  - Alternatives: IV Ceftriaxone, IV Cefotaxime

### 3. Management of Complications:

- AKI → Dialysis if oliguric or severe
- Pulmonary hemorrhage → ICU support, mechanical ventilation
- Coagulopathy → blood products as needed

## Prevention

- Avoid wading in potentially contaminated water
- Protective clothing and gloves for high-risk occupations
- Rodent control
- Prophylactic doxycycline in endemic outbreaks (weekly)

✅ **Key Points for Exams:**

- Classic triad: **Fever + Myalgia (calves) + Conjunctival suffusion**
- Severe form = **Weil’s disease (jaundice + AKI + hemorrhage)**
- Early antibiotics reduce morbidity and mortality
