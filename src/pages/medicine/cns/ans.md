# Sympathethic and Parasympathetic Nerves

- The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates involuntary physiological functions.
- It has two main divisions: the `parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)` and the `sympathetic nervous system (SNS)`.
- These systems often have opposite effects on the same organs to maintain homeostasis.

## Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)

> Prepares the body for `fight-or-flight` responses during stressful situations.

### Characteristics [#sns]

- **Origin**: Thoracolumbar region (T1-L2) of the spinal cord.
- **Structure**: Short preganglionic fibers and long postganglionic fibers.

### Neurotransmitters [#sns]

- Preganglionic: Acetylcholine (ACh).
- Postganglionic: Norepinephrine (NE) and sometimes epinephrine.

### Effects [#sns]

- **Heart**: Increases heart rate and contractility.
- **Lungs**: Dilates bronchioles.
- **Blood Vessels**: Constricts most blood vessels (increasing blood pressure) but dilates vessels in skeletal muscles.
- **Eyes**: Dilates pupils (mydriasis).
- **Digestive System**: Inhibits digestion (reduces gastrointestinal activity).
- **Liver**: Stimulates glucose release.
- **Sweat Glands**: Stimulates sweating.

## Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)

> Promotes `rest-and-digest` activities, conserving energy and maintaining daily bodily functions.

### Characteristics [#pns]

- **Origin**: Craniosacral region (brainstem nuclei of cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X and sacral spinal cord S2-S4).
- **Structure**: Long preganglionic fibers and short postganglionic fibers.

### Neurotransmitter [#pns]

- Acetylcholine (ACh) for both preganglionic and postganglionic fibers.

### Effects [#pns]

- **Heart**: Decreases heart rate and contractility.
- **Lungs**: Constricts bronchioles.
- **Blood Vessels**: Little effect on most vessels; dilates vessels in erectile tissue.
- **Eyes**: Constricts pupils (miosis) and stimulates lens accommodation for near vision.
- **Digestive System**: Stimulates digestion (increases gastrointestinal activity).
- **Bladder**: Promotes urination by contracting the detrusor muscle and relaxing the internal urethral sphincter.
- **Salivary Glands**: Stimulates salivation.

## Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic

- **Sympathetic Tone**: Dominant during stress, exercise, and emergencies.
- **Parasympathetic Tone**: Dominant during rest, relaxation, and digestion.
- **Dual Innervation**: Most organs receive inputs from both systems, allowing fine-tuned regulation.
- **Antagonistic Actions**: Generally, one system activates a physiological response while the other inhibits it.
