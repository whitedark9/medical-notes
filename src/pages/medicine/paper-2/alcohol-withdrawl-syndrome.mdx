# Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome

## Pathophysiology

- Chronic alcohol intake → enhances **GABA (inhibitory)** and suppresses **NMDA (excitatory glutamate)**
- Brain adapts → ↓ GABA receptor sensitivity + ↑ NMDA receptor upregulation
- Sudden withdrawal of alcohol → ↓ inhibitory tone + ↑ unopposed excitatory tone
- Results → **autonomic hyperactivity + neuropsychiatric manifestations**

## Clinical Features (Timeline Based)

1. **Minor withdrawal (6–12 hrs after last drink):**

   - Tremors (coarse)
   - Anxiety, irritability
   - Insomnia, restlessness
   - Nausea, vomiting, anorexia
   - Palpitations, diaphoresis

2. **Alcoholic hallucinosis (12–24 hrs):**

   - Auditory hallucinations > visual > tactile
   - Clear sensorium (distinguishes from delirium tremens)

3. **Withdrawal seizures (24–48 hrs):**

   - Generalized tonic–clonic seizures
   - Usually multiple, brief, self-limiting

4. **Delirium tremens (48–72 hrs; peak at 3–5 days):**

   - Confusion, disorientation, fluctuating consciousness
   - Severe agitation
   - Visual hallucinations (classical: insects/animals)
   - Autonomic hyperactivity (↑ BP, tachycardia, fever, diaphoresis)
   - Medical emergency

## Complications

- Seizures → status epilepticus
- Delirium tremens → high mortality (arrhythmia, aspiration pneumonia, cardiovascular collapse)
- Wernicke’s encephalopathy (due to thiamine deficiency)
- Electrolyte imbalance (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **Clinical diagnosis** (based on history of alcohol use + withdrawal symptoms)
- CIWA-Ar score (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol – revised)

### For Causes/Contributing Factors

- Serum ethanol level (may be low/undetectable in withdrawal)
- Electrolytes: Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, phosphate
- Blood glucose
- LFTs (alcoholic liver disease)

### For Complications

- ECG (arrhythmias)
- CXR (aspiration pneumonia)
- CT brain (if atypical seizures, trauma, or head injury suspected)

## Management

### Emergency (ABCDEF Approach)

- **A – Airway:** ensure patency, prevent aspiration
- **B – Breathing:** oxygen if hypoxemic
- **C – Circulation:** IV access, fluids (cautious if alcoholic cardiomyopathy)
- **D – Disability:** check GCS, control seizures (IV `benzodiazepines`)
- **E – Exposure:** monitor vitals, prevent hyperthermia
- **F – Fingerstick glucose:** correct hypoglycemia

### Specific Management

1. **Pharmacological**

   - `Benzodiazepines` (first-line): diazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide (tapering dose)
   - `Thiamine`: IV before glucose to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy
   - `Anticonvulsants:` not routinely, only if seizures persist despite benzodiazepines
   - `Antipsychotics` (e.g., `haloperidol`): only for severe hallucinations/agitation (cautious: lower seizure threshold)

2. **Supportive**

   - Fluid & electrolyte correction (Mg²⁺ important)
   - Nutritional support (multivitamins, folate)
   - Quiet, well-lit room (reduce sensory misinterpretation)

## Long-Term Management

- **Detoxification programs**
- **Relapse prevention:**

  - `Acamprosate` (NMDA modulator)
  - `Naltrexone` (opioid receptor antagonist)
  - `Disulfiram` (aversive therapy, not first-line)

- **Psychological support:** CBT, group therapy (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous)
