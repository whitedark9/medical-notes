# Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

## Definition

- Chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease
- Primarily targets synovial joints → progressive, symmetrical polyarthritis
- Leads to joint destruction, deformity, and disability
- Can have extra-articular manifestations involving skin, eyes, lungs, heart, blood vessels, and nervous system

## Pathophysiology

Genetic susceptibility (HLA-DRB1 "shared epitope")
→ Environmental triggers (smoking, infections, periodontal disease)
→ Autoantigen presentation (e.g., citrullinated peptides) by antigen-presenting cells
→ Activation of CD4+ T cells → release of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6)
→ B cell activation → production of autoantibodies (`RF`, `anti-CCP`)
→ Immune complexes deposit in synovium
→ Chronic synovial inflammation → proliferation of synovial lining cells (pannus formation)
→ Pannus invades cartilage and bone → **joint pain**, **swelling**, **deformity**
→ Osteoclast activation → bone erosion
→ Fibrosis and ankylosis in late disease

## Symptoms and signs

### Articular features

- Symmetrical involvement of small joints (MCP, PIP, wrists)
- Morning stiffness >1 hour
- Swelling, warmth, tenderness of joints
- Decreased range of motion
- Joint deformities: ulnar deviation, swan neck, boutonnière deformity, Z-thumb
- Large joints (knees, shoulders, elbows) may also be involved in advanced disease

### Extra-articular features

- **Skin**: rheumatoid nodules (firm, non-tender, over pressure points)
- **Eyes**: episcleritis, scleritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sjögren's)
- **Lungs**: pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease, rheumatoid lung nodules
- **Heart**: pericarditis, increased risk of atherosclerosis
- **Nervous system**: peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, cervical myelopathy (atlantoaxial subluxation)
- **Haematology**: anaemia of chronic disease, Felty’s syndrome (RA + splenomegaly + neutropenia)
- **Vasculitis**: skin ulcers, nailfold infarcts

## Investigations

### For diagnosis

- **Rheumatoid factor (RF)** – positive in \~70–80% (not specific, also in other conditions)
- **Anti-CCP antibodies** – high specificity (\~95%) and predictive of erosive disease
- **ANA** – sometimes positive in RA (low titre)
- **ESR** and **CRP** – elevated in active disease
- **Full blood count** – anaemia of chronic disease, leukopenia, thrombocytosis
- **Joint aspiration** – turbid synovial fluid, WBC >2000/mm³, neutrophil predominance, sterile culture

### For causes and risk factors

- HLA typing – HLA-DRB1 association (research/academic use)

### For complications

- **X-ray of affected joints** – early: periarticular osteopenia, soft tissue swelling; late: joint space narrowing, marginal erosions, deformities
- **Ultrasound/MRI** – detects early synovitis and erosions before X-ray changes
- **Pulmonary function tests and HRCT** – in suspected interstitial lung disease
- **Echocardiography** – in suspected pericarditis or cardiac involvement

## Diagnosis criteria

### 2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria for RA

- A score ≥6/10 is needed for classification (patient must have synovitis in at least 1 joint and no better alternative diagnosis)

| Domain                                  | Criteria                                   | Points |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------ |

|                                         | 2–10 large joints                          | 1      |
|                                         | 1–3 small joints (± large)                 | 2      |
|                                         | 4–10 small joints (± large)                | 3      |
|                                         | >10 joints (≥1 small joint)                | 5      |
| **Serology** (at least one test result) | Negative RF and negative anti-CCP          | 0      |

|                                         | High-positive RF or high-positive anti-CCP | 3      |
| **Acute-phase reactants**               | Normal CRP and ESR                         | 0      |

## Management

### General Principles

- **Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment** to prevent irreversible joint damage
- Treat-to-target approach aiming for **remission** or **low disease activity**
- Multidisciplinary care: rheumatologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, specialist nurse
- Patient education, lifestyle advice, vaccination review

### Pharmacological Management

#### A. First-line therapy (new diagnosis)

1. `MTX` 15 mg weekly + `Prednisolone` 30 mg daily

   - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue `MTX` alone
   - DAS28 ≥ 3.2: proceed to combination therapy

#### B. Combination DMARD therapy (if DAS28 ≥ 3.2)

1. Add `SSZ` and `HCQ` to `MTX`

   - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue `MTX` + `SSZ` + `HCQ`
   - DAS28 3.2 – 5.1: consider SC `MTX` or different `cDMARD`

     - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue therapy
     - DAS28 ≥ 3.2: proceed as DAS28 ≥ 5.1

   - DAS28 ≥ 5.1: Add biologic or `tsDMARD`

#### C. Biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs

- Indicated if DAS28 remains ≥ 5.1 despite cDMARDs
- Examples: anti-TNF agents, IL-6 receptor antagonists, JAK inhibitors
- Monitor for infections, TB screening before initiation

#### D. Glucocorticoids

- Short-term bridging therapy during DMARD initiation
- Gradual taper to avoid long-term side effects

#### E. Symptomatic relief

- NSAIDs, analgesics for pain control
- PPIs for GI protection if NSAIDs used

### Non-Pharmacological Therapy

1. Physiotherapy
1. Occupational therapy
1. Psychologist support

### Surgery

1. Synovectomy
1. Joint arthroplasty
1. Metatarsalosteotomies, ulna head excisionwith wrist synovectomy
1. Upper cervical spine fixation
1. Joint fusion
