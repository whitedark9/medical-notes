<Steps>

### First Aid Treatment

- Check for **fang marks** (may be absent in krait bites).
- **Immobilize** the limb as for a fracture.
- Most bites (70%) are non-venomous.
- Lymphatic spread: Avoid blocking blood flow or applying pressure.
- ~~DO NOT use a tight tourniquet, cut the wound, or attempt suction~~
- No herbal remedies are proven effective.

### Transport to Hospital

- Transport the victim quickly, safely and passively

### Rapid Clinical Assessment and Resuscitation

1. Airway
1. Breathing, Bleeding
1. Circulation, conscious level
1. Disability (weakness)
1. Vital signs
1. PRIMARY
   - Hypovolaemia\*\*\*
   - Vasodilatation \*\*
   - Cardiotoxicity\*\*
   - Anaphylaxis\*
1. SECONDARY
   - Capillary Leakage Syndrome
   - Antivenom reaction
   - Respiratory failure
   - Acute pituitary adrenal insufficiency
   - Septicaemia

### Investigations/Laboratory Tests

> Investigate the venom is `haemotoxic Â± nephrotoxic` OR `neurotoxic`

1. For haemotoxic
   - `20 minutes whole blood clotting test` (20 WBCT)
1. For neurotoxic
   - `Spirometer` (FEV1 and FVC): FEV < 1.5 L ICU referal
   - `Single-breath counting test` (SBC): < 30 per single-breath
1. Basic investigations
   - `Urinalysis` or `urine albumin`
   - `Haematocrit`: increased in capillary leak syndrome
   - `Platelet`: may be decreased in viper bite
   - `WBC`: an early neutrophil leucocytosis is evidence of systemic envenoming
   - `Blood film`: microangiopathic haemolysis
   - `Renal function test`
   - `CK` for rhabdomyolysis
1. Local signs
   - local swelling, painful tender enlarged local lymph glands, Persistent bleeding from the bite wound,
1. Monitoring hourly
   - Blood pressure, pulse rate, bleeding (gums, nose, vomit, stool or urine)
   - Level of consciousness, drooping eyelids (ptosis) and other signs of paralysis.

### Species Diagnosis

> Most common snakes in Myanamr are Elapidae (cobra, kraits) , Viperidae (vipers), Colubridae Hydrophiidae (sea snakes).

### Antivenom Treatment

- ~~Never IM inj~~
- **No absolute contraindication to ASV**
- No dose adjustment for children
- Side effects: ~~Anaphylaxis reaction (Revive with ABC), Hypersensitivity reaction (Give more ASV)~~

<details>
<summary>For Haemotoxic Signs (Viper Bite Guideline)</summary>

- 20 WBCT
  - If _Clot_:
    1.  Observe for 24 hour (for dealy envenoming)
    1.  20 WBCT 2 hourly for first 12 hours
    1.  20 WBCT 4 hourly for next 12 hours
        - If ~~Non-clot~~: `ASV (viper) 80ml`
    - If ~~Non-Clot~~:
    - Local symtoms only: `ASV (viper) 80 ml`
    - Other systemic symptoms: `ASV (viper) 160 ml`

</details>

<details>
<summary>For Neurotoxic signs</summary>

1. `ASV (cobra) 40 ml`
1. Monitoring & 20 WBCT
   - If _Clot_: Continue
   - If ~~Non-clot~~: **Viper Bite Guideline**

</details>

### Observing the Response to Antivenom

> Envenoming can recur[^1] within 24-48 hr!

- In viper bite:
  - **20 WBCT** every 6 hours until clotted (Regeneration of clotting factors takes 6 hours)
  - **Bleeding** stops within 30 min
  - **Hypotension** recovers within 30-60 min

### Supportive Treatment

1. `Antibiotics`
1. `Fluid` resuscitation
1. Beware of compartment syndrome
1. `Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)`: After 48 hours (Third day)
1. `Mechanical Ventilation` (Even after specific ASV)

### Treatment of the Bitten Part

1. Surgical wound debridement may needed
1. Compartment syndrome

### Follow-up

- **Discharge** if asymptomatic after 24 hours
- **Observe** for 48 hours if ASV was given
- **Return** if bleeding, worsening pain/swelling, breathing issues, or altered sensorium
- **Educate** on late complications (e.g., Sheehan's syndrome in viper bites)

### Rehabilitation and Prevention

- Health Education about snake bite, correct first aid measures
- Skin grafting
- Prothesis for amputee
