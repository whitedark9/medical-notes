## Reasons / Pathophysiology

### Type 1 (Hypoxaemic)

- **Pathway:**
  Lung pathology → impaired oxygen transfer across alveolar–capillary membrane → ↓ PaO₂ → PaCO₂ often normal or low due to compensatory hyperventilation
- **Mechanisms:**
  A. Ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) mismatch (e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary embolism)
  B. Right-to-left shunt (e.g. ARDS, intracardiac shunt)
  C. Diffusion limitation (e.g. pulmonary fibrosis)
  D. Low inspired oxygen (e.g. high altitude)

### Type 2 (Hypercapnic)

- **Pathway:**
  Alveolar hypoventilation → inadequate CO₂ clearance → ↑ PaCO₂ → respiratory acidosis ± hypoxaemia
- **Mechanisms:**
  A. Airway obstruction (e.g. COPD, severe asthma)
  B. Reduced respiratory drive (e.g. CNS depression, brainstem lesion, sedative overdose)
  C. Neuromuscular weakness (e.g. Guillain–Barré, myasthenia gravis)
  D. Chest wall restriction (e.g. obesity hypoventilation, kyphoscoliosis)
