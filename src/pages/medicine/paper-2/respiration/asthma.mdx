# Bronchial Asthma

> A chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterised by recurrent episodes of **wheezing**, **breathlessness**, **chest tightness** and **coughing**, particularly **at night and in the early morning**, which has **variable** airflow obstruction within the lung that is often **reversible**, either spontaneously or with treatment.

## Precipitating Factors

> ICE ABCDE

1. Upper respiratory tract **i**nfection
1. **C**old air
1. **E**xercise
1. **A**llergens or pollutants (e.g., dust, pollens, pets)
1. **B**etel nuts
1. **C**hemical irritants (e.g. paint, aerosols)
1. **D**rugs (β-blockers, aspirin, NSAIDs, OC pills, cholinergic agents, prostaglandin F2α)
1. **E**motional upset or anxiety

## Clinical Features

### History

- Recurrent episodes of wheezing, chest tightness, breathlessness and cough (_Typical symptoms_)
  - Reversibility (spontaneously or with treatment)
  - Variability (diurnal variation, day to day variation of symptoms)
- Presence of precipitating factors
- Presence of atopy
- Presence of genetics or family history of asthma
- History of exacerbations and hospitalization

### Physical Examination

- Pigeon chest, Harrison sulcus
- During asthmatic attack:
  - No mediastinal shift
  - Reduced chest wall movement on both sides
  - Hyper-resonance on percussion with obliteration of cardiac and liver dullness
  - Reduced vesicular breath sound with prolonged expiratory phase
  - Bilateral widespread rhonchi
  - Reduced vocal resonance

## Investigations

1. **Spirometry**
   - If not available, use **peak flow meter**
1. **Challenge tests**: Airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) has higher negative value
1. **Exercise tests**: if symptoms are related to exercise
1. **Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Elevated in patients who are highly likely to respond to glucocorticoids
1. **Skin-prick tests or measurement of total and allergen-specific IgE**: To detect peripheral blood eosinophilia or atopy

<summary>Diagnosis of Asthma </summary>

Compatible **clinical history** _plus_ either/or:

- `FEV1 ≥ 12% (and 200 mL) increase` after bronchodilator/trial of glucocorticoids. Greater confidence if `FEV1 > 15% and > 400 mL`
- `FEV1 ≥ 15% decrease` after 6 mins of exercise
- `> 20% diurnal variation` on ≥ 3 days in a week for 2 weeks on peak expiratory flow (PEF) diary

## Management

### Non-Pharmacology

- Avoid triger factors
- Health education about asthma
- Self-management plan
- Cessation of smoking

### Stepwise Approach to the Management of Asthma

- Use `short-acting β2 agonists (SABA)` as required in all stages
  - Consider moving up if SABA is used 3 doses a week or more
- Discontinue trial drugs if they are ineffective
- Maintain at optimal control with the lowest step and lowest dose of treatment
- Decreasing the dose of glucocorticoid by around 20-25% every 3 months is a resonable strategry for most patients

#### Step 1: Regular Preventer

- `Low dose inhaled glucocorticoid (ICS)`
- Higher doses may be required for smokers

#### Step 2: Initial Add-on Therapy

- Add `long-acting beta agonists (LABA)` to `low dose ICS` (fixed dose or MART)

#### Step 3: Additional Add-on Therapies

- Review the asthma in details
- Consider:
  - Increasing `ICS` to medium dose **OR**
  - Trial of `leukotriene antagonists (LTRA)` or a slow-release `theophylline`
- If no response to `LABA`, consider stopping `LABA`

#### Step 4: High-dose Therapies

- `High dose ICS`
- Consider trial of `LTRA`, `long-acting anti-muscarinic agents (LAMA)`, `theophylline` or a slow-release `oral β2-agonists`

#### Step 5: Continuous or Frequent Use of Oral Glucocorticoids

- `Oral prednisolone` (usually single daily dose in the morning)
  - `Bisphosphonates` for long-term high-dose oral glucocorticoid therapy (to reduce risk of osteoporosis)
- `Omalizumab (anti-IgE) therapy` for severe IgE-driven atopic asthma

1. Remove the cap and shake the inhaler
1. Breathe out gently and place the mouthpiece into the mouth
1. Incline the head backwards to minimise oropharyngeal deposition
1. Simultaneously, begin a slow deep inspiration, depress the canister and continue to inhale
1. Hold the breath for 10 seconds

<summary>Side effects of asthma medication</summary>

1. **Beta-2 agonists**: Hypokalemia, tremor, palpitation
1. **ICS**: Oral thrush, hoarseness of voice, Increase risk of pneumonia
1. **LTRA**: Liver dysfunction, associated with Churg-Srauss syndrome
1. **Theophylline**: Arrhythmia, convulsion
1. **Oral steroid**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis
1. **Omalizumab**: Hypersensitivity reaction
