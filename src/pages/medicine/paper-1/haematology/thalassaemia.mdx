# Thalassaemia

> An autosomal recessive inherited impairment of haemoglobin production due to partial or complete failure to synthesise a specific type of globin chain.

## Types

<details>
<summary>New classification of thalassaemia</summary>

1. Transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (TDT)
1. Non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia (NTDT)

</details>

1. **Beta-thalassaemia** (Failure to synthesise beta chains)
   1. **Thalassaemia major or Homozygotes**: Profound transfusion-dependent hypochromic anaemia
   1. **Thalassaemia minor or Heterozygotes**: mild microcytic anaemia or no clinical effect
1. **Alpha-thalassaemia** (Reduced or absent alpha-chain synthesis)
   1. **One chain deleted**: No clinical effect
   1. **Two chains deleted**: Mild hypochromic anaemia
   1. **Three chains deleted**: Haemoglobin H disease
   1. **All four chains deleted**: Stillborn (Hydrops fetalis)

## Clinical Features of Beta-thalassaemia Major

- Present in first 4-6 months of life
- Features of anaemia
- Growth retardation
- Recurrent infection
- Thalassaemic face: Frontal bossing, depressed nasal bridge, prominent malar eminence, malformed teeth
- Long bone fracture and osteoporosis
- Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly
- Jaundice
- Features of iron overload
- Major causes of death: Severe anaemia, heart failure, liver failure, infections

## Investigations

<details>
<summary>Diagnostic features of beta-thalassaemia</summary>

Beta-thalassaemia major (homozygotes)

1. Profound hypochromic anaemia
1. Evidence of severe red cell dysplasia
1. Erythroblastosis
1. Absence or gross reduction of the amount of haemoglobin A
1. Raised levels of haemoglobin F
1. Evidence that both parents have thalassaemia minor

Beta-thalassaemia minor (heterozygotes)

1. Mild anaemia
1. Microcytic hypochromic erythrocytes (not iron-deficient)
1. Some target cells
1. Punctate basophilia
1. Raised haemoglobin A2 fraction

</details>

1. **Haemoglobin electrophoresis**: HbA ↓/absent, HbA2↑, HbF↑
1. **Haemogram**: Hb↓, Retic count↑, MCV↓, MCH↓, MCHC↓, WBC normal/↑, Platelet normal/↑
1. **Blood film**: Hypochromic microcytic anaemia, Anisopoikilocytosis [^1], features of haemolysis
1. **Iron study**: Serum iron normal/↑, Ferritin↑, TIBC normal/↓, transferrin saturation normal/↑
1. **Ultrasound**: For hepatosplenomegaly
1. **Skull X-ray**: Hair-on-end apperance
1. **Hand X-ray**: Lace-like appearance
1. **Investigations for iron overload and transfusion-transmitted infections**

## Management

> Management of haemoglobin H disease is similar to that of beta-thalassaemia of intermediate severity.

1. For erythropoietic failure:
   - **Cure**: Allogeneic `HSCT`(Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) from HLA (Human Leucocyte Antigen)-compatible sibling
   - `Transfusion` to maintain Hb > 10 g/dL
   - `Folic acid` 5 mg daily
1. For iron overload
   - Avoid iron-rich food, Iron therapy
   - `Iron chelation therapy` (`desferrioxamine`, `desferiprone`, `deferasirox`)
1. For splenomegaly
   - `Splenectomy`

<details>
<summary>Indication for splenomegaly</summary>

1. Hypersplenism
1. Symptomatic massive splenomegaly
1. Transfusion requirement > 250 ml/kg/year of packed red cells or > 400 ml/kg/year of whole blood

- Age: > 6 year-old to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis
- Pneumococcal vaccine, meningococcal vaccine, haemophilus influenzae vaccine: 4-6 weeks prior to splenectomy and booster dose after
- Life-long `penicillin` prophylaxis
- Low dose `aspirin` for thrombosis

</details>

<details>
<summary>Management of splenectomised patient</summary>

1. **Vaccinate** with pneumococcal, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B, meningococcal group C and influenza vaccines at least 2-3 weeks before elective splenectomy
1. Pneumococcal **re-immunisation** should be given at least 5-yearly and influenza annually
1. `Life-long prophylatic penicillin V` (500mg twice daily); Consider `macrolide` for penicillin allergic patients
1. **Health education** about the risks of infection and methods of prophylaxis
1. **A card or bracelet** should be carried to alert health professionals
1. In **sepsis**, give IV antibiotics to cover pneumococcus, _Haemophilus_ and meningococcus
1. **Risk of cerebral malaria** is increased in the event of infection
1. **Animal bites** should be promptly treated with local disinfection and antibiotics to prevent serious soft tissue infection and sepsis

</details>

## Preventation

- Chorionic villous material for DNA analysis to identify a fetus with homozygous beta-thalassaemia and to allow `termination`
- Appropriate only if both parents are carriers (beta-thalassaemia minor)
