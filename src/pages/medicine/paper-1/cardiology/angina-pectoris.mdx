# Angina Pectoris

> A symptom complex caused by transient myocardial ischaemia, which occurs whenever there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.

<details>
<summary>
Factors influencing myocardial oxygend supply and demand
</summary>

Oxygen Supply: **Coronary blood flow**

1. Duration of diastole
1. Coronary perfusion pressure
1. Coronary vasomotor tone
1. Oxygenation: Haemoglobin, Oxygen saturation

Oxygen Demand: **Cardiac work**

1. Heart rate
1. Blood pressure
1. Myocardial contractility
1. Left ventricular hypertrophy
1. Valve disease

</details>

## Causes

1. Coronary atherosclerosis (**most common**)
1. Coronary artery spasm
1. Aortic valve disease, Aortic stenosis
1. Aortitis
1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

## Clinical Features

> Three characteristic features of angina
>
> 1. Constricting discomfort in the centre of the chest, or in the neck, shoulders, jaw or arms
> 2. Precipitated by physical exertion
> 3. Relieved by rest (or `Glyceryl Trinitrate`) within 5 minutes

### Classification

1. **Typical angina**: All 3 features
1. **Atypical angina**: 2 features
1. **Non-anginal chest pain**: 1 or 0 features

### NICE Classification

1. **Possible angina**: Typical angina, Atypical angina or Non-anginal chest pain with an abnormal resting 12-lead ECG
1. **Non-anginal chest pain**: Non-anginal chest pain with a normal resting 12-lead ECG

## Investigation

1. **Exercise ECG**
   - Planar ST depression & Down-sloping depression are usually indicates myocardial ischaemia
   - Confirm the history of exertional angina
   - Provide an object measure of the patient's exercise tolerance
   - Indicate the underlying disease severity
1. Imaging:
   - **CT coronary angiography**: Provide detailed antatomical information about the extent and nature of CAD
   - **Myocardial perfusion scanning**
   - **Stress echocardiography**

## Management

### Algorithm

<details>
<summary>A scheme for the investigation and treatment of stable angina on effort</summary>

1. Clinical consultation, History and examination
1. Blood tests and 12-lead ECG, Consider chest X-ray and echocardiography
1. Consider exercise ECG
1. Clear diagnosis of angina?
   - If _Yes_: **Obstructive coronary artery disease**
   - If ~~No~~: Non-anginal chest pain and normal ECG?
     - If _Yes_: **No coronary artery disease**
     - If ~~No~~: CT coronary angiography
       1. **No coronary artery disease**
          1. Consider alternative diagnosis
       1. **Non-obstructive coronary artery disease**
          1. Consider preventive therapies
       1. **Obstructive coronary artery disease**
          1. Preventive therapies
          1. Anti-anginal therapy
          1. Consider invasive coronary angiography ± revascularisation

</details>

### General Management

> SAVED

1. `S`moking
   - Cessation of smoking
1. `A`lcohol
   - Reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption
1. `V`accination
   - Consideration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination
1. `E`ducation
   - Explanation of nature of disease, treatment and self-help strategies
1. `E`xercise
   - Regular moderate exercise within limit
1. `D`iet
   - Good nutrition and weight reduction
   - Avoidance of salty foods

### Pharmacological Management

#### Anti-platelet Therapy

> All patients with angina secondary to CAD should receive antiplatelet therapy.

1. Low dose (75 mg) `aspirin` or `clopidogrel` (75 mg daily)
1. `Statin` (e.g., `atorvastatin`, `rosuvastatin`) even if serum cholesterol concentration is normal

#### Anti-anginal Therapy

- Start therapy: `Sublingual GTN` and `β-blockers`
- Add a `calcium channel antagonist` or a `long-acting nitrate` if needed
- If combination of 2 drugs fails, consider `coronary revascularisation`

<Tabs items={['Simple', 'Details']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. Nitrates
   - `Sublingual GTN`, `Oral isosorbide dinitrate`
1. Beta-blockers
   - `Bisoprolol`, `Carvedilol`, `Metoprolol`
1. Calcium channel antagonists
   - Dihydropyridine: `Nifedipine`, `Amlodipine`
   - Non-Dihydropyridine: `Verapamil`, `Diltiazem`
1. `Nicorandil` (Potassium channel activators) (_Alternative to nitrates_)
1. `Ivabradine`
1. `Ranolazine`

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. Nitrates
   - `Sublingual GTN`, `Oral isosorbide dinitrate`
   - MOA: Venous and arteriolar dilatation
   - Side Effects: ~~headache~~, ~~symptomatic hypotension~~, ~~syncope (rare)~~
   - Caution: _a 6-8-hour nitrate-free peroid to avoid pharmacological tolerance_
1. Beta-blockers
   - `Bisoprolol`, `Carvedilol`, `Metoprolol`
   - MOA: Lower myocardial oxygen demand
   - Contraindication: ~~asthma~~
   - Caution: _Do not withdrawl abruptly. Rebound effects may precipitate dangerous arrhythmias, worsening angina or MI (β-blockers withdrawl syndrome)_
1. Calcium channel antagonists
   - `Nifedipine`, `Amlodipine`, `Verapamil`, `Diltiazem`
   - MOA: Lower myocardial oxygen demand
   - Dihydropyridine calcium antagonists (`Nifedipine`, `Amlodipine`) may cause reflex tachycardia, use in combination with a `β-blocker`
   - `Verapamil`, `Diltiazem`cause bradycardia, useful when `β-blockers` are contraindicated.
   - Side Effects: ~~peripheral oedema~~, ~~flushing~~, ~~headache~~, ~~dizziness~~
1. `Nicorandil` (Potassium channel activators)
   - The only drug
   - MOA: Venous and arteriolar dilatation (same as `nitrates`)
   - No tolerance like nitrates
1. `Ivabradine`
   - Safe to use in heart failure
1. `Ranolazine`
   - Reduce angina symptoms

### Non-Pharmacological Management

<Tabs items={["Simple", "Details"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   - Can be combined with a deployment of a coronary stent
   - Adjunctive therapy to improve outcome (`clopidogrel` + `aspirin` + `heparin`)
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
   - Adjunctive therapy to improve outcome (`clopidogrel` or `aspirin`, lipid-lowering therapy)

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

#### Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)

- Can be combined with a deployment of a coronary stent
- Provides excellent symptom control
- Do not reduce MI or improve survival in patients with chronic stable angina
- Mainly used in single or two-vessel disease
- Complications:
  - Acute: Occlusion of coronary artery by thrombus or a loose flap of intima and consequent MI
  - Long-term: Restenosis (stenting substantially reduces the risk of restenosis)
- Adjunctive therapy (Anti-platelet Therapy)
  - `P2Y12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor)` + `aspirin` + `heparin` to improve outcome

#### Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

- Internal mammary arteries, radial arteries or reversed segments of the patient's own saphenous vein can be used
- Arterial grafts have a much better long-term patency rate
- Adjunctive Therapy:
  - `Aspirin` (75-150 mg daily) or `Clopidogrel` (75 mg daily)
  - Intensive lipid-lowering therapy

## Prognosis

> Depend on the burden of CAD and degree of left ventricular dysfunction.

- Single-vessel disease and good left ventricular function has a 5-year survival rate of > 90%.
- Three-vessel disease and severe left ventricular function has a 5-year survival rate < 30%.
