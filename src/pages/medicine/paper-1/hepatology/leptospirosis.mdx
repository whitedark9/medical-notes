# Leptospirosis

> An acute zoonotic infection caused by _Leptospira interrogans_ (spirochete), transmitted to humans via water, soil, or food contaminated with urine of infected animals (rats most common reservoir).

## Clinical Features

> **Incubation period**: 7–12 days

### Symptoms

- Sudden high fever, chills, rigors
- Severe headache, retro-orbital pain
- Myalgia (calf and lumbar muscles most affected → characteristic)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Conjunctival suffusion (redness without discharge – classical sign)
- Photophobia
- Rash (occasionally)

### Signs

- Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly
- Jaundice (in severe Weil’s disease)
- Lymphadenopathy
- Meningeal signs (aseptic meningitis)
- Hypotension, tachycardia
- Renal tenderness (if nephritis present)

## Complications

- **Weil’s disease** (severe form):

  - Jaundice (hepatic failure)
  - Renal failure (acute tubular necrosis)
  - Hemorrhage (pulmonary, gastrointestinal, subconjunctival)

- Aseptic meningitis / encephalitis
- Myocarditis, arrhythmias
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
- Pancreatitis
- Uveitis (late)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **CBC** → leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia
- **LFTs** → elevated bilirubin (mainly conjugated), mild ↑ transaminases
- **RFTs** → raised creatinine, urea (renal involvement)
- **Urinalysis** → proteinuria, hematuria

### Microbiological Tests

- Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) → gold standard serology
- ELISA for IgM leptospira antibodies (more widely used)
- PCR for leptospiral DNA (early diagnosis)
- Dark-field microscopy / culture (rarely used, difficult)

### For Complications

- Chest X-ray → pulmonary hemorrhage / ARDS
- ECG → arrhythmias, myocarditis
- CSF analysis → lymphocytic pleocytosis (aseptic meningitis)

## Management

### General measures

- Hospital admission if moderate/severe disease
- Rest, hydration (oral/IV fluids)
- Monitor renal and liver function
- Dialysis if renal failure develops

### Medical management

- **Mild cases**:

  - `Doxycycline` (100 mg PO twice daily × 7 days)
  - Alternative: `Amoxicillin` / `Azithromycin` if `doxycycline` contraindicated

- **Severe cases (Weil’s disease)**:

  - IV `Penicillin` G (1.5 MU IV every 6 hourly × 7 days)
  - Alternative: IV `Ceftriaxone` or `Cefotaxime`

- `Analgesics` and `antipyretics` for symptoms

### Prevention

- Protective clothing for workers exposed to contaminated water
- Doxycycline prophylaxis (200 mg once weekly) for high-risk exposure (e.g., soldiers, farmers in endemic areas)
- Rodent control, sanitation improvement
