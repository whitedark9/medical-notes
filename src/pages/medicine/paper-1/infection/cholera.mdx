# Cholera

- **Causal Organism**: _Vibrio cholerae_ (serogroups O1 and O139)
- **Mode of transimission**: Contaminated water or food
- **Incubation period**: Few hours to 5 days

## Clinical Features

### Symptoms

- Sudden onset of profuse, painless watery diarrhea (“rice-water stools”)
- Vomiting (without nausea)
- Thirst, muscle cramps
- Weakness, dizziness

### Signs

- Features of dehydration:

  - Sunken eyes, dry tongue, poor skin turgor
  - Hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria/anuria
  - Shock in severe cases

- No abdominal pain or tenesmus
- Consciousness usually preserved until late stages

## Complications

- Severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock
- Acute renal failure (due to hypoperfusion)
- Electrolyte imbalance (hypokalemia → muscle weakness, arrhythmia; metabolic acidosis)
- Death if untreated

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- Clinical diagnosis in outbreaks is sufficient
- Stool microscopy → motile _Vibrio_ with dark-field microscopy
- Stool culture → definitive diagnosis (TCBS agar)
- Rapid diagnostic tests (dipstick for cholera antigen)

### For Complications

- Serum electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺, HCO₃⁻)
- Renal function tests (urea, creatinine)

## Management

### 1. Immediate Resuscitation

- **Mild to moderate dehydration** → `Oral Rehydration Solution` (ORS, WHO formula)
- **Severe dehydration** → I`V Ringer’s lactate` (preferred) or normal saline:

  - Adult: 100 ml/kg in 3 phases (30 ml/kg in first 30 min, then 70 ml/kg over 2.5 hrs)
  - Children: give 30 ml/kg in 1 hr, then 70 ml/kg in 5 hrs

- Monitor urine output, BP, pulse

### 2. Antibiotics (shorten duration & stool volume)

- Adults: `Doxycycline` single dose (300 mg) **OR **`Azithromycin` 1 g single dose
- Children: `Azithromycin` / `Erythromycin` (10–12 mg/kg)
- Pregnant women: `Azithromycin` is safe

### 3. Supportive Care

- `Zinc` supplementation in children (\<5 yrs) → reduces severity/duration
- Nutrition → continue feeding, especially breastfeeding in infants

## Outbreak Management

### 1. Early Detection & Reporting

- Immediate notification to health authorities
- Surveillance for new cases

### 2. Case Management

- Rapid rehydration centers established in affected areas
- Stockpiling ORS, IV fluids, antibiotics

### 3. Prevention of Spread

- Ensure safe drinking water (chlorination, boiling)
- Sanitation: proper disposal of feces, hygiene promotion
- Hand washing campaigns
- Food safety measures

### 4. Community Measures

- Health education: recognize symptoms, early ORS use at home
- Distribution of ORS packets widely
- Avoid raw seafood, street food, unboiled water

### 5. Vaccination

- `Oral cholera vaccines` (`Dukoral`, `Shanchol`, `Euvichol`) → useful in endemic areas or outbreaks
- Provide herd protection when mass immunization campaigns are done
