# Hepatic Encephalopathy

> A neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease that occur in 30%-40% of patients with cirrhosis.

## Precipitating Factors

> SAND DICK

- Portosystemic `s`hunting
- `A`mmonia: ↑Protein load [^1] (including GI bleeding)
- Hypo`n`atraemia
- `D`rugs (e.g. sedatives, anti-depressants)
- `D`ehydration (including diuretics, paracentesis)
- `I`nfection
- `C`onstipation
- Hypo`k`alaemia

## Differential Diagnosis

> Wilson Wernicke Withdrawl Alcohol, Hungry Psycho Bleed after Seize

- Neurological `Wilson`'s disease
- `Wernicke`'s encephalopathy
- Delirium tremens/alcohol `withdrawal`
- Drug or `alcohol` intoxication
- Hypoglycaemia
- Primary `psy`chiatric disorders
- Intracranial `bleed` (subdural/extradual haematoma)
- Post-ictal state

## Clinical Features

### Symptoms

- Mild fluctuating (early)
- Inability to concentrate
- Delirium
- Disorientation
- Drowsiness
- Slurring of speech
- Seizure (rare)
- Coma

### Signs

- Flapping tremor (asterixis)
- Inability to perform simple mental arithmetic tasks or to draw objects such as a star (constructional apraxia)
- Hyper-reflexia
- Bilateral extensor planter responses
- Fetor hepaticus (Stupor or A sweet musty odour to the breath) (Common in liver failure and portosystemic shunting)
- Cerebellar degeneration (in chronic hepatic encephalopathy; rare)
  - Cerebellar dysfunction
  - Parkinsonian syndromes
  - Spastic paraplegia
  - Dementia

## Classifications

- **Grade 1**: Altered mood, sleep disturbance, constructional apraxia, no flapping tremor
- **Grade 2**: Increasing drowsiness, confsion, slurred speech + flapping tremor, personality change
- **Grade 3**: Flapping tremor, Fetor hepaticus
- **Grade 4**: Coma

## Investigations

1. **Usually clinically**
1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**
1. **↑Arterial ammonia**

## Management

> Treat or remove precipitating causes. <br/>Suppress the production of neurotoxins by bacteria in the bowel.

1. `Lactulose` (15-30 mL)
   - Increase gradually until bowel movements twice daily
1. `Phosphate enemas`
   - In patients with refractory constipation or oral route is compromised
1. `Rifaximin` (550 mg twice daily)
   - Reduce recurent hepatic encephalopathy
1. `L-ornithine L-arginine` (LOLA)
   - To lower ammonia levels and improve encephalopathy
1. `Endotracheal intubation` if needed to protect airway
1. Dietary protein restriction is not recommended
