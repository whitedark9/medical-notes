# Acute Exacerbations of Asthma

## Investigations

- Measurement of **PEF** (Mandatory)
- **Arterial blood gas (ABG)**: To detect PaCO2 is essential for life-threatening or near-fatal asthma
- **Chest X-ray**: Not immediately unless pneumothorax is suspected

## Assessment

### Mild to Moderate Asthma

- 'Rescuse' `glucocorticoids` (`prednisolone 40-50 mg/day`)
  - Short courses (at least 5 days)
  - Tapering off if > 3 weeks

<details>
<summary>Indications for 'rescuse' courses</summary>

- PEF < 75% of patient's personal best recording
- Sleep disturbance by asthma
- Persistence of morning symptoms until midday
- Low response to an inhaled bronchodilator
- Require treatment with nebulised bronchodilators

</details>

### Severe Asthma

<details>
<summary>Assessment of Acute Severe Asthma</summary>

1. Acute severe asthma (_PaRTly_)
   - **P**EF 33% - 50% predicted (< 200 L/min)
   - Heart rate ≥ 110 beats/min (**T**achycardia)
   - **R**espiratory rate ≥ 25 breaths/min
   - Inability to complete sentences in 1 breath (Partly)
1. Life-threatening features (_DO CPR EACH Chest Before Coma_)
   - **D**elirium
   - Sp**O2** < 92% or PaO2 < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) (especially if being treated with oxygen)
   - Normal or raised Pa**CO2**
   - **P**EF < 33% predicted (< 100 L/min)
   - Feeble **r**espiratory effort
   - **E**xhaustion
   - **a**rrhythmias
   - **C**yanosis
   - **H**ypotension
   - Silent **chest**
   - **B**radycardia
   - **Coma**
1. Near-fatal asthma
   - Raised PaCO2 and/or requiring mechanical ventilation with raised inflation pressures

</details>

## Management

> Doubling the dose of ICS does not prevent an impending exacerbation!

### 1. PEF 76% - 100% Best or Predicted

- If PEF of the patient is 76% - 100% **without nebulised therapy**,
  - Give usual inhaled bronchodilator
  - Observe for 60 mins
  - Discharge with usual treatment
- If patient got the PEF **with nebulised therapy**,
  - Wait 30 min and measure PEF

### 2. PEF 51% - 75% Best or Predicted

- Arterial blood gas analysis
- Nebulised `salbutamol 5 mg` or `terbutaline 2.5 mg`
- High flow 60% `Oxygen`
- `Oral prednisolone 40 mg`
- Wait 30 min and measure PEF
  - If PEF > 60%,
    - Discharge
    - Continue `oral prednisolone` for 5 days
    - Start or double `ICS`
  - If PEF < 60%,
    - Admit to hospital
    - Follow PEF < 50% management

### 3. PEF < 50% Best or Predicted

- Arterial blood gas analysis
- Nebulised `salbutamol 5 mg` or `terbutaline 2.5 mg` 6-12 times daily or as required
- High flow 60% `Oxygen`
- `Oral prednisolone 40 mg` (or `IV hydrocortisone 200 mg`)

#### More Investigations

- IV access
- Chest X-ray
- Plasma theophylline level
- Plasma K+
- Pulse oxymetry
- Repeat ABG may be necessary

#### After Admission

- Administer repeat `salbutamol 5 mg + ipratropium bromide 500 μg` by oxygen-driven nebuliser
- Consider `continuous salbutamol nebuliser 5-10 mg/hr `
- Consider `IV magnesium sulphate 1.2-2.0 g` over 20 mins or `aminophylline 5 mg/kg` loading dose over 20 mins followed by a continuous infusion at 1 mg/kg/hr
- Correct `fluid and electrolytes` (especially K+)
- `Assisted ventilation`: Endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV)

<details>
<summary>Indications for assisted ventilation in acute severe asthma</summary>

1. Coma
1. Respiratory arrest
1. Deterioration of ABG tensions despite optimal therapy:
   - PaO2 < 8 kPa (60 mmHg) and falling
   - PaCO2 > 6 kPa (45 mmHg) and rising
   - pH low and falling (H+ high and rising)
1. Exhaustion, delirium, drowsiness

</details>

#### Discharge

- Patients should be stable and have free nebulised therapy for at least 24 hours before discharge
- Return immediately if worse
- Get appointment withint 48 hours
- Avoid triger factors
- Health education about asthma
- Self-management plan
- Cessation of smoking

## Prognosis

- Generally good
