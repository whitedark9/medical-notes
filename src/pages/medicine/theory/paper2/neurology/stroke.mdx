## Management

> Stroke is a medical emergency!

<details>
<summary>Emergency Management of Stroke Algorithm</summary>

1. Clinical diagnosis of stroke
1. Neuroimaging
   1. Ischaemic stroke → Eigible for urgent reperfusion therapy?
      - If _Yes_: `IV thrombolysis` and/or `Mechanical thrombectomy` → **Acute storke unit care**
      - If ~~No~~: `Aspirin` → **Acute stroke unit care**
   1. Haemorrhagic stroke
      - Reverse coagulation abnormality → Lower BP (< 140 mmHg) → **Acute stroke unit care**
1. Acute stroke unit care
1. Identify cause and plan secondary prevention

</details>

<summary>How to manage a patient with acute stroke</summary>

1. **Airway**
   - Perform bedside swallowing screen
   - Consider nasogastric tube for feeding if swallowing is unsafe
1. **Breathing**
   - Check respiratory rate
1. **Circulation**
   - Check peripheral perfusion, pulse and blood pressure
1. **Hydration**
   - Give fluids parenterally or by nasogastric tube if needed
1. **Nutrition**
   - Provide supplements if needed
   - Consider feeding via nasogastric tube if swallowing is unsafe
1. **Medication**
   - Consider other routes if dysphagic
1. **Blood pressure**
   - Haemorrhagic stroke:
     - Consider lowering systolic blood pressure to 130-140 mmHg
     - Maintain this blood pressure for at least 7 days
   - Ischaemic stroke:
     - Unless heart or renal failure, evidence of hypertensive encephalopathy or aortic dissection, Do not lower blood pressure abruptly
   - Check blood glucose and treat if diabetes is diagnosed
   - Avoid hypoglycaemia
1. **Temperature**
   - Investigate and treat underlying cause if pyrexial
   - Control temperature with antipyretics
1. **Pressure areas**
   - Reduce risk of skin breakdown:
     - Treat infection
     - Maintain nutrition
     - Provide pressure-relieving mattress
     - Turn immobile patients regularly
1. **Incontinence**
   - Check for constipation and urinary retention; treat these appropriately
   - Avoid urinary catheterisation unless patient is in acute urinary retention or incontinence is threatening pressure areas
1. **Prevention of deep vein thrombosis**
   - Consider intermittent pneumatic compression stockings in immobile patients
1. **Mobilisation**
   - Avoid bed rest after the first 24 hours

<summary>Strategies for secondary prevention of stroke/Management of risk factors</summary>

1. Ischaemic Stroke ← Single typical TIA
   - **ECG**
     - If _Sinus rhythm_: Request prolonged ECG monitoring if cortical TIAs/stroke
       - If _Sinus rhythm_:
         1. `Antiplatelet therapy` (`Aspirin` 300 mg at once, 75 mg daily or `Clopidogrel` 75 mg daily)
         1. `Lower cholesterol` with high intensity statin after checking liver function tests
         1. `Lower BP` if BP > 130/70 mmHg 1-2 weeks after onset (`Thiazide diuretic`, `ACE inhibitor`, Other agents)
         1. `Lifestyle modification` (Smoking cessation, Lower salt intake, Lower fat intake, Lower excess alcohol intake, Lose excess weight, Increase exercise)
       - If ~~Atrial fibrillation/Paroxysmal AF~~
     - If ~~Atrial fibrillation/Paroxysmal AF~~: **Thyroid function tests** and **Echocardiogram** → Consider `Rate control` & `Anti-arrhythmic`
       - If ~~contraindications~~ to anticoagulation (e.g. bleeding, falls, binge drinking, poor compliance) → `Antiplatelet Therapy` → `Lower cholesterol` → `Lower BP` → `Lifestyle modification`
       - If _no contraindications_: `Anticoagulation` direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs); `Warfarin` with target INR 2-3 (or 3.5 if mechanical prosthetic valve) → `Lower cholesterol` → `Lower BP` → `Lifestyle modification`
   - **Carotid duplex** → Refer if > 50% stenosis on symptomatic side → **Carotid endarterectomy** (surgery) → `Antiplatelet Therapy` → `Lower cholesterol` → `Lower BP` → `Lifestyle modification`
1. Haemorrhagic Stroke → `Lower BP` → `Lifestyle modification`

### Carotid Endarterectomy and Arterial Angioplasty

- Removal of >50% stenosis by carotid endarterectomy reduces recurrent risk in severe stroke
- Operation itself has 3%-4% stroke risk

### Supportive

- Admit the patient to a specialised stroke unit

### Rehabilitation

<details>
<summary>Poor recovery conditions</summary>

- Old age
- Pre-existing disability
- Multi-morbidity
- Pre-existing cognitive impairment
- Physical illness
- Post-stroke pneumonia or delirium
- Poor motivation and apathy
- Fatigue
- Depression
- Pain

</details>

- To maximise functional recovery and prevent complications
- Three phases of recovery:
  1. Early recovery: Resolution of cerebral oedema nad cerebral reperfusion
  1. Neuroplasticity (Rewiring): New areas of brain take over from damaged areas of brain
  1. Adaptive recovery: Patient learns new strategies to live with their disability
- Physical milestones: Sitting → Standing → Stepping → Walking

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Reperfusion

- Reperfusion in ischaemic stroke
- `IV Thrombolysis` best within 4.5 hours
- `Mechanical Thrombectomy` best within 6 hours
- Contraindications: ~~High bleeding risk~~

### Anti-platelet Therapy

- Aspirin (300 mg daily) in major ischaemic stroke
- Withheld for at least 24 hours if thrombolysis has been given
- Two anti-platelet agents (Aspirin + Clopidogrel) in minor ischaemic stroke or TIA

### Reverse Coagulation Abnormalities

- In intracerebral haemorrhage, reverse coagulation abnormalities quickly

### Blood Pressure

- Early reducing of blood pressure improves outcome in intracerebral haemorrhage, but not in ischaemic stroke
- Long-term blood pressure reducing is important in both cases

### Carotid Endarterectomy and Arterial Angioplasty

- Removal of stenosis by carotid endarterectomy reduces recurrent risk in severe stroke
- Operation itself has 3%-4% stroke risk

### Supportive

- Admit the patient to a specialised stroke unit
