# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

> An irreversible deterioration in renal function that usually develops over a period of years.

## Staging

- **Stage 1**: Kidney damage with normal or high eGFR (> 90)
- **Stage 2**: eGFR (60 - 89)
- **Stage 3a**: eGFR (45 - 59)
- **Stage 3b**: eGFR (30 - 44)
- **Stage 4**: eGFR (15 - 29)
- **Stage 5**: eGFR < 15 or the need for dialysis

## Causes

> DIG CRUSH

1. `D`iabetes mellitus (20%-45%)
1. `I`nterstitial diseases (20%-30%)
   - Drug-induced
   - Reflux nephropathy
1. `G`lomerular diseases (10%-20%)
   - IgA nephropathy
1. `C`ongenital and inherited (10%)
   - Polycystic kidney disease
   - Alport syndrome
1. `R`enovascular disease (5%)
   - Atheromatous
1. `U`nknown (5%-10%)
1. `S`ystemic inflammatory diseases (5%-10%)
   - SLE
   - Vasculitis
1. `H`ypertension (5%-20%)

## Clinical Features

- Reduced eGFR (found incidentally during routine blood tests)
- Nocturia (early symptom)
- Tiredness or breathlessness (renal anaemia or fluid overload)
- Kussmaul breathing (metabolic acidosis)
- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss (uraemic gastritis)
- Fits, drowsiness, coma (uraemic encephalopathy)
- Pruritus
- Hiccups
- Muscular twitching

## Investigations

> Exclude AKI requiring rapid investigation<br/>
> Identify the cause<br/>
> Identify reversible factors<br/>
> Screen for complications of CKD<br/>
> Screen for cardiovascular risk factors.

1. **Creatinine, eGFR**
   - To assess stability/progression
   - Compare to previous results
1. **Urinalysis and quantification of proteinuria**
   - Haematuria and proteinuria indicate glomerular disease and need for biopsy
   - Proteinuria indicates risk of progressive CKD requiring ACE inhibitors or ARB therapy
1. **Electrolytes**
   - To identify hyperkalaemia and acidosis
1. **Calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D**
   - Assessment of renal osteodystrophy
1. **Albumin**
   - Low albumin: consider malnutrition, inflammation, nephrotic syndrome
1. **Full blood count (±Fe, ferritin, folate, B12)**
   - If anaemic, exclude common non-renal explanations, then manage as renal anemia
1. **Lipids, glucose ± HBA1c**
   - Cardiovascular risk high in CKD
   - Treat risk factors aggressively
1. **Renal ultrasound**
   - Consider with obstructive urinary symptoms (persistent haematuria, family history of polycystic kidney disease or progressive CKD)
   - Small kidneys suggest chronicity
   - Asymmetric renal size suggests renovascular or congenital disease
1. **Hepatitis and HIV serology**
   - If dialysis or transplant is planned, Hep B vaccination is recommanded if seronegative
1. **Other tests**
   - If cause is unknown, consider relevant tests from [AKI Investigation](/medicine/theory/nephrology/acute-renal-injury#clinical-features)

## Management

> Monitor renal function<br/>
> Prevent or slow further renal damage<br/>
> Limit complications<br/>
> Treat risk factors for cardiovascular disease<br/>
> Prepare for RRT, if appropriate.

### Monitor Renal Function

- Monitor **every 6 months** in patients with state 3 CKD
- More frequently in rapid deteriorating or stage 4 or 5 CKD

### Reduction of Rate of Progression

1. Anti-hypertensive therapy
   - CKD with no albuminuira (ACR < 3mg/mmol): `Target BP: < 140/90 mmHg`
   - CKD with diabetes or ACR > 70 mg/mmol: `Target BP: < 130/80 mmHg`
1. Reduction of proteinuria
   - `ACE inhibitors`, `ARBs`
   - Reduce proteinuria and slow progression of CKD
   - Should be prescribed to **all patients with diabetic nephropathy** and **CKD with proteinuria** (_± hypertension_)
   - May exacerbate pre-renal failure
   - Contraindication: ~~Baseline K+ > 5.5 mmol/L~~
   - ~~Combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs or direct renin inhibitors should be avoided~~

### Treatment of Complications

#### 1. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance

1. Urea
   - A key product of protein degradation and accumulates with progressive CKD
   - `Prevent excessive protein comsumption`
   - Severe protein restriction may lead to malnutrition
1. Potassium
   - Accumulates in advanced CKD
   - `Reduce daily potassium intake`
   - Reduce drugs that elevate potassium (`potassium-sparing diuretics`, `ACE inhibitors`/`ARBs`)
   - Use `potassium-binding compounds` (`sodium ziconium cyclosilicate`, `patiromer`) to limit gut absorption
   - `Calcium resonium` is not recommanded (can cause bowel necrosis)
1. Sodium and water
   - `Reduce daily sodium intake`
   - `Restrict fluid intake in severe case`
   - `High dose loop diuretics` or `Combination of loop, thiazide, potassium-sparing diuretics` may be required

#### 2. Acid-base balance

- `Sodium bicarbonate supplements` (as required)

#### 3. Renal bone disease

- Disturbance of phosphate and calcium metabolism in advanced CKD leads to renal bone disease
- Elevated PTH level (secondary hyperparathyroidism) → Bone resorption (osteitis fibrosa cystica)
- Calcium + Phosphate → Increase deposition of calcium phosphate in many tissues (blood vessels, heart valves)
- **Hyperphosphataemia**:
  - `Dietary restriction of foods` with high phosphate content (milk, cheese, eggs and protein-rich foods)
  - Use `phosphate-binding drugs` (`Calcium carbonate`, `aluminium hydroxide`, `lanthanum carbonate`) and `polymer-based phosphate binders` (`sevelamer`) to reduce gut absorption
- **Hypocalcaemia** or **Serum PTH level > twice upper limit of normal**:
  - `Active vitamin D metabolites`
- **Persistent hypercalcaemia (tertiary hyperparathyroidism)**:
  - `Parathyroidectomy` (if unavailable or failed, `calcimimetic agents` (`cinacalcet`))

#### 4. Anaemia

- Haemoglobin 5-7 g/dL in CKD stage 5
- Common: Iron deficiency anaemia
- Correct with `iron supplements`
- Correcting haemoglobin to normal levels has higher risk of hypertension and thrombosis
- **Target haemoglobin: Between 10 and 12 g/dL**
- ~~Avoid blood transfusion~~

### Treatment of Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease

- Common: Left ventricular hypertrophy in CKD (secondary hypertension or anaemia) → Risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardic death
- `Life style modifications` to reduce vascular risk

### Preparing for Renal Replacement Therapy

- Refer to nephrologist
- Choose between haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, between hospital and home treatment, and on referral for renal transplantation
- Hepatitis B vaccination
