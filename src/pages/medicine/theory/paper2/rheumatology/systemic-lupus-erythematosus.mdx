<summary>Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)</summary>

> Vasoconstriction of the small vessels of the hand and feet in response to cold, leading to pallor followed by cyanosis of the affected digits followed by vasodilatation causing the affected digits to turn red.

## Criteria for SLE Classification

> An adult has SLE if any 4 of 11 features are present serially or simultaneously.

## Investigations

1. **Check ANAs**: Almost always _positive_ in active SLE
1. **Antibodies to ENAs**
1. **Complement**: C3 may be low in active SLE
1. **Routine haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis**
1. **ESR**: Typically _raised_ in active SLE
1. **Full blood count**: _Leucopenia_, _Lymphopenia_ are typical of active SLE
1. **CRP**: Often _normal_; _Elevated_ in SLE + serositis or co-existing infection

## Management

### Patient Education

- Nature of the illness
- Avoid sun and ultraviolet light exposure
- Use sun blocks
- Cessation of smoking
- Reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption
- Low intensity regular aerobic exercise

### Mild to Moderate Disease

- **Standard Therapy**:
  1.  `Analgesics`, `NSAIDs` and `Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)`
  1.  `Glucocorticoids` (`prednisolone` 5-20 mg/day) **+** `Immunosuppressants` (`Methotrexate (MTX)`, `Azathioprine` or `Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)`)
      - Increase dose of `glucocorticoids` in active SLE or complications (pelurisy, pericarditis)
- If inadequately response to above therapy, **Add** `monoclonal antibody belimumab` IV
- Address poor sleep hygiene

### Severe and Life-threatening Disease

- **For renal, CNS, cardiac involvement**: `High dose glucocorticoids` **+** `Immunosuppressants`
- **Commonly used regime**: `Methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg IV)` **+** `Cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg IV)`, repeated at 2-3 weekly intervals for 6 cycles
  - Good hydration and `Mesna` to minimise haemorrhagic cystitis caused by `cyclophosphamide`
  - Store sperm or oocyte for the risk of azoospermia and premature menopause cauded by cyclophosphamide
- **SLE + Renal involvement**: `High-dose glucocorticoids` + `MMF` (fewer adverse effects)
- Safe and well-tolerated regime: `Belimumab` + `Standard therapy`

### Maintenance Therapy

- `Oral prednisolone` 40-60 mg daily, gradually reducing to 10-15 mg/day or less by 3 months **OR** `Azathioprine` (2-2.5 mg/kg/day) **OR** `MTX` (10-25 mg/week) **OR** `MMF` (2-3 g/day)
- Maintain remission with lowest dose of `glucocorticoid` and `immunosuppressants` possible
- `Life-long warfarin therapy` for SLE + Anti-phospholipid syndrome with previous thrombosis
- **Lifestyle modification** to reduce cardiovascular risks
- **Screening** for risk of osteoporosis and hypovitaminosis D
