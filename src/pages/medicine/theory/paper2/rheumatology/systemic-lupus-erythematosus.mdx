1. **Routine haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis**
1. **ESR**: Typically _raised_ in active SLE
1. **Full blood count**: _Leucopenia_, _Lymphopenia_ are typical of active SLE
1. **CRP**: Often _normal_; _Elevated_ in SLE + serositis or co-existing infection

## Management

### Patient Education

- Nature of the illness
- Avoid sun and ultraviolet light exposure
- Use sun blocks
- Cessation of smoking
- Reduction or cessation of alcohol consumption
- Low intensity regular aerobic exercise

### Mild to Moderate Disease

- **Standard Therapy**:
  1.  `Analgesics`, `NSAIDs` and `Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)`
  1.  `Glucocorticoids` (`prednisolone` 5-20 mg/day) **+** `Immunosuppressants` (`Methotrexate (MTX)`, `Azathioprine` or `Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)`)
      - Increase dose of `glucocorticoids` in active SLE or complications (pelurisy, pericarditis)
- If inadequately response to above therapy, **Add** `monoclonal antibody belimumab` IV
- Address poor sleep hygiene

### Severe and Life-threatening Disease

- **For renal, CNS, cardiac involvement**: `High dose glucocorticoids` **+** `Immunosuppressants`
- **Commonly used regime**: `Methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg IV)` **+** `Cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg IV)`, repeated at 2-3 weekly intervals for 6 cycles
  - Good hydration and `Mesna` to minimise haemorrhagic cystitis caused by `cyclophosphamide`
  - Store sperm or oocyte for the risk of azoospermia and premature menopause cauded by cyclophosphamide
- **SLE + Renal involvement**: `High-dose glucocorticoids` + `MMF` (fewer adverse effects)
- Safe and well-tolerated regime: `Belimumab` + `Standard therapy`

### Maintenance Therapy

- `Oral prednisolone` 40-60 mg daily, gradually reducing to 10-15 mg/day or less by 3 months **OR** `Azathioprine` (2-2.5 mg/kg/day) **OR** `MTX` (10-25 mg/week) **OR** `MMF` (2-3 g/day)
- Maintain remission with lowest dose of `glucocorticoid` and `immunosuppressants` possible
- `Life-long warfarin therapy` for SLE + Anti-phospholipid syndrome with previous thrombosis
- **Lifestyle modification** to reduce cardiovascular risks
- **Screening** for risk of osteoporosis and hypovitaminosis D

## Definition

- Chronic, multisystem, autoimmune inflammatory disease
- Characterized by production of autoantibodies against nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens
- Relapsing-remitting course with periods of flares and remission
- Pathogenesis: loss of self-tolerance → immune complex formation → complement activation → tissue inflammation and damage

## Symptoms and signs

### General

- Fatigue
- Fever (low-grade)
- Weight loss
- Myalgia and arthralgia

### Skin and mucous membranes

- **Malar rash** – erythematous rash over cheeks and nasal bridge, sparing nasolabial folds
- Discoid rash – scaly, erythematous, chronic plaques → scarring
- Photosensitivity – rash or lesions precipitated/worsened by UV exposure
- **Oral/nasopharyngeal ulcers** – usually painless
- Alopecia

### Musculoskeletal

- **Symmetrical, non-erosive polyarthritis** (small joints, large joints)
- Arthralgia without deformity
- Tendonitis and myositis possible

### Renal

- Lupus nephritis: proteinuria, haematuria, hypertension, oedema

### Neurological

- Seizures, psychosis
- Cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders
- Peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis

### Cardiorespiratory

- Pleuritis, pericarditis
- Myocarditis, endocarditis (Libman–Sacks)
- Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension

### Haematological

- Anaemia of chronic disease
- Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
- Leukopenia, lymphopenia
- Thrombocytopenia

### Gastrointestinal

- Abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, mesenteric vasculitis

## Investigations

### For diagnosis

- **ANA (antinuclear antibody)** – highly sensitive (>95%) but not specific
- **Anti-dsDNA** – specific, correlates with disease activity, especially lupus nephritis
- **Anti-Smith (Anti-Sm)** – highly specific but less sensitive
- **Antiphospholipid antibodies** – lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2 glycoprotein I
- **Complement levels (C3, C4)** – low during active disease
- **ESR** – elevated (CRP often normal unless infection)
- **Full blood count** – anaemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia
- **Renal function** – urea, creatinine, electrolytes
- **Liver function tests** – may be abnormal
- **Urinalysis** – proteinuria, haematuria, casts
- **Coagulation profile** – if antiphospholipid syndrome suspected

### For causes and associated factors

- **Antihistone antibodies** – for drug-induced lupus
- **Viral serologies** (e.g., hepatitis, HIV) – if clinically indicated

### For complications

- **24-hour urinary protein** or **spot protein-creatinine ratio** – nephritis severity
- **Echocardiography** – pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis
- **Nerve conduction studies** or **MRI** – neurological manifestations

### Imaging

- **Chest X-ray** – pleuritis, pleural effusion, ILD
- **Echocardiography** – pericardial effusion, valvular lesions
- **MRI brain/spinal cord** – CNS lupus, transverse myelitis

## Pathophysiology flow

Loss of self-tolerance in genetically susceptible host
→ Environmental triggers (UV light, infections, drugs) cause apoptosis
→ Defective clearance of apoptotic cells → persistence of **nuclear antigens** in circulation
→ Activation of dendritic cells → presentation of nuclear antigens to autoreactive T and B cells
→ B cell activation → production of autoantibodies (**ANA**, **anti-dsDNA**, **anti-Sm**)
→ Formation of antigen–antibody immune complexes
→ Deposition of immune complexes in tissues
→ Activation of complement system (**low C3, C4**)
→ Recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages → release of proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species
→ **Skin inflammation** → **malar rash**, photosensitivity
→ **Synovial inflammation** → **arthritis**
→ **Mucosal inflammation** → **oral ulcers**
→ Immune complex glomerular injury → lupus nephritis
→ Vasculitis of small vessels → skin lesions, CNS manifestations
→ Haematological autoimmunity → anaemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

## Management

### 1. General measures

- Education about disease and triggers (e.g., UV light, stress, infection)
- Sun protection (broad-spectrum sunscreen, protective clothing)
- Regular exercise, balanced diet
- Avoid smoking (reduces cardiovascular and renal risk)
- Vaccinations (pneumococcal, influenza, HPV) before starting immunosuppression

### 2. Drug therapy

#### A. Mild disease (skin, joints, mucosal involvement only)

- **`Hydroxychloroquine`** (HCQ) – cornerstone for all SLE patients unless contraindicated

  - Improves skin and joint symptoms, reduces flares, prevents organ damage
  - Dose: ≤5 mg/kg/day to reduce retinopathy risk
  - Eye examination at baseline and annually after 5 years

- **`NSAIDs`** – for arthritis, myalgia (short term, monitor renal and GI side effects)
- **`Low-dose corticosteroids`** (prednisolone ≤10 mg/day) – for flare control while other agents act

---

#### B. Moderate disease (serositis, mild-moderate hematologic or renal disease)

- **`Oral corticosteroids`** (prednisolone 10–30 mg/day, taper when possible)
- **`Azathioprine`** or **`Methotrexate`** – steroid-sparing agents
- **`Mycophenolate mofetil`** – for moderate nephritis or if azathioprine intolerant

#### C. Severe / organ-threatening disease (lupus nephritis, CNS lupus, severe hematologic disease)

- **Induction therapy**:

  - **`High-dose corticosteroids`** (IV methylprednisolone pulses 500–1000 mg/day × 3 days) → taper to oral
  - Plus **`Cyclophosphamide`** (low-dose Euro-Lupus regimen or NIH regimen)
  - Or **`Mycophenolate mofetil`** (alternative to cyclophosphamide in many cases)

- **Maintenance therapy**:

  - **`Azathioprine`** or **`Mycophenolate mofetil`**

- **Biologics**:

  - **`Belimumab`** (anti-BLyS) – for persistent active disease despite standard therapy
  - **`Rituximab`** – off-label for refractory severe SLE

#### D. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in SLE

- **`Warfarin`** (target INR 2–3) for thrombotic APS
- **`Low-dose aspirin`** for asymptomatic high-risk patients
- In pregnancy: **`Heparin`** + low-dose aspirin

#### E. Special situations

- Pregnancy:

  - Continue **`Hydroxychloroquine`**
  - Use **`Azathioprine`** if immunosuppression needed (max 2 mg/kg/day)
  - Avoid mycophenolate, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide

- Vaccination: avoid live vaccines during immunosuppression

### 3. Monitoring

- Disease activity scores (SLEDAI, BILAG)
- Clinical assessment for new organ involvement
- Blood: CBC, ESR, CRP, complement, anti-dsDNA
- Renal: urinalysis, protein-creatinine ratio
- Drug toxicity: LFTs, renal function, drug-specific monitoring (e.g., eye exams for HCQ)
