# Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA)

> This occurs when iron losses or physiological requirements exceed absorption.

<details>
<summary>Common causes of anaemia</summary>

#### 1. Decreased RBC Production

1. Nutritional Deficiencies
   - Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
   - Vitamin B12 deficiency (Pernicious anaemia)
   - Folate deficiency
1. Bone Marrow Disorders
   - Aplastic anaemia
   - Myelodysplastic syndrome
   - Leukaemia
1. Chronic Diseases
   - Chronic kidney disease (â†“ erythropoietin)
   - Chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis)
   - Endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism)

#### 2. Increased RBC Destruction (Haemolysis)

1. Intrinsic RBC Defects
   - Sickle cell disease
   - Thalassemia (alpha & beta)
   - Hereditary spherocytosis
   - G6PD deficiency
1. Extrinsic RBC Destruction
   - Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
   - Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) (e.g., DIC, TTP, HUS)
   - Infections (e.g., malaria, _Clostridium perfringens_)
   - Drug-induced haemolysis

#### 3. Blood Loss

1. Acute Blood Loss
   - Trauma
   - Gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., peptic ulcer, varices, colorectal cancer)
   - Obstetric causes (e.g., postpartum haemorrhage)
1. Chronic Blood Loss
   - Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia)
   - Occult GI bleeding (e.g., colon cancer, hookworm infection)

</details>

## Causes

### 1. Blood Loss

In men and post-menopausal women:

1. **GI blood loss** (common):
   - Gastric or colorectal malignancy
   - Gastritis
   - Peptic ulcer
   - Inflammatory bowel disease
   - Diverticulitis
   - Polyps
   - Angiodysplastic lesions
   - Worsen by chronic use of aspirin or NSAIDs
1. **Hookworm and schistosomiasis** (common)

In women of child-bearing age:

1. Menstrual blood loss
1. Pregnancy
1. Breastfeeding

Very rare:

- Chronic haemoptysis or haematuria

### 2. Malabsorption

- Low-iron diet
- Achlorhydria[^1] in older people or that due to PPI
- Coeliac disease

### 3. Physiological Demands

- Rapid growth periods: Infancy, puberty
- Pregnancy

## Investigations

<Tabs items={['Simple', 'Details']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

- For Diagnosis
  - **Serum ferritin (Best single test)**: Decreased
  - **Plasma iron** and **Total iron binding capicity (TIBC)**: Decreased
  - **Transferrin**: Decreased
  - **Soluble transferrin receptors**: Increased
  - **Bone marrow aspirate**
- For Underlying Cause
  - **Endoscopy or radiological studies**: For upper and lower GI tract blood loss
  - **Antibody testing**: To exclude coeliac disease
  - **Stool and urine tests**: To detect parasites in the tropics

</Tabs.Tab>

### For Diagnosis

1. **Serum ferritin (Best single test)**:
   - Measure of iron stores in tissues
   - Decreased due to IDA, (rarely hypothyroidism, Vit C deficiency)
1. **Plasma iron** and **Total iron binding capicity (TIBC)**:
   - Measure iron availability
   - Both decreased
1. **Transferrin**:
   - The binding protein for iron
   - Less specific than ferritin
   - Decreased
1. **Soluble transferrin receptors**: Increased
1. **Bone marrow aspirate** for iron stores in difficult cases

### For Underlying Cause

- Depend on age, sex, history, clincal findings
- **Endoscopy or radiological studies**: For upper and lower GI tract in men and post-menopausal women with a normal diet
- **Antibody testing**: To exclude coeliac disease
- **Stool and urine tests**: To detect parasites in the tropics

## Management

<Tabs items={['Simple', 'Details']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Iron Replacement Therapy
   - Oral Iron Replacement: `Ferrous sulphate` daily continued for 3-6 months
   - Parenteral Iron Therapy: `ferric isomaltose`, `ferric carboxymaltose`, `iron dextran`, `iron sucrose`
   - Blood Transufsion: `Packed red cells`
1. Treat Underlying Cause
   - For [variceal bleeding](/medicine/theory/hepatology/portal-hypertension#management)
   - For hookworm infestation: Deworming with anti-helminths

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

### Iron Replacement Therapy

#### Oral Iron Replacement

- `Ferrous sulphate` 200 mg 3 times daily (195 mg of elemental iron per day) continued for 3-6 months (to replete iron stores)
- Side effect: ~~GI disturbances (dyspepsia, altered bowel habit)~~
- _Delayed-released preparations are not useful_
- Hb should rise > 1 g/dL every 7-10 days; If not, check non-adherence, continued blood loss, malabsorption or an incorrect diagnosis

#### Parenteral Iron Therapy

- Indications: **Malabsorption, Chronic gut disease or Intolerance to oral iron replacement**
- New preparations of `ferric isomaltose` and `ferric carboxymaltose` (have fewer allergic effects)
- `Iron dextran` or `iron sucrose`
- Calculate doses based on patient's Hb and body weight

#### Blood Transufsion

- Indications: **If above treatment failed, Hb < 7 g/dL, Active bleeding, Acute myocardial ischaemia, Heart failue or neurological symptoms**
- `Packed red cells`

### Treat Underlying Cause

1. For [variceal bleeding](/medicine/theory/hepatology/portal-hypertension#management)
1. For hookworm infestation: Deworming with anti-helminths
