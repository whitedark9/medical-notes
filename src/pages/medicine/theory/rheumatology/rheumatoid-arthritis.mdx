# Rheumatoid Arthritis

> RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis.

## Clinical Features

## Criteria for Diagnosis

> Patients with a score ≥ 6 are considerd to have definite RA.

| Criteria                             | Score |
| :----------------------------------- | :---- |
| **Joints affected**                  |       |
| 1 large joint                        | 0     |
| 2-10 large joints                    | 1     |
| 1-3 small joints                     | 2     |
| 4-10 small joints                    | 3     |
| > 10 joints (at least 1 small joint) | 5     |
| **Serology**                         |       |
| Negative RF and ACPA                 | 0     |
| Low positive RF or ACPA              | 2     |
| High positive RF or ACPA             | 3     |
| **Duration of symptoms**             |       |
| < 6 weeks                            | 0     |
| > 6 weeks                            | 1     |
| **Acute phase reactants**            |       |
| Normal CRP and ESR                   | 0     |
| Abnormal CRP or ESR                  | 1     |

APCA = anti-citrullinated peptide antibody

## Investigations and Monitoring

- **To establish diagnosis**
  1. Clinical criteria
  1. ESR and CRP
  1. Ultrasound or MRI
  1. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)
- **To monitoring disease activity and drug efficacy**
  1. Pain
  1. Early morning stiffness (minutes)
  1. Joint tenderness
  1. Joint swelling
  1. DAS28
  1. ESR and CRP
- **To monitor disease damage**
  1. X-rays
  1. Functional assessment
- **To monitor drug safety**
  1. Urinalysis
  1. Full blood count
  1. Chest X-ray
  1. Urea and creatinine
  1. Liver function tests

- Count swollen joints
- Count tender joints
- Measure ESR
- Note patient global health assessment (1-100)

Interpretation

| Score       | Activity             |
| :---------- | :------------------- |
| > 5.1       | High activity        |
| ≥ 3.2 - 5.1 | Moderate activity    |
| 2.6 - 3.2   | Low disease activity |
| < 2.6       | Remission            |

## Management

### Algorithm

1. New diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
1. MTX 15 mg weekly + Prednisolone 30 mg daily
   - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue MTX alone
   - ~~DAS28 ≥ 3.2~~: Add SSZ and HCQ
     - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue MTX + SSZ + HCQ
     - ~~DAS28 3.2 - 5.1~~: Consider SC MTX or different cDMARD
       - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue therapy
       - ~~DAS28 ≥ 3.2~~: Continue as ~~DAS28 ≥ 5.1~~
     - ~~DAS28 ≥ 5.1~~: Add biologic or tsDMARD
       - _DAS28 < 3.2_: Continue therapy
       - ~~DAS28 ≥ 3.2~~: Consider change to different biologic or tsDMARD

## Non-Pharmacological Therapy

1. Physiotherapy
1. Occupational therapy
1. Psychologist support

## Surgery

1. Synovectomy
1. Joint arthroplasty
1. Metatarsalosteotomies, ulna head excisionwith wrist synovectomy
1. Upper cervical spine fixation
1. Joint fusion
