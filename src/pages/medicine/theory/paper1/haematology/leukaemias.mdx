## Differences Between ALL, CLL, AML, CML, HL, NHL

| Feature                  | Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL)                                  | Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL)                         | Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)                       | Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)                              | Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)                             | Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)                         |

| **Onset**                | Sudden, rapid progression                                      | Slow, indolent progression                              | Sudden, rapid progression                          | Gradual progression                                         | Gradual onset                                     | Variable, may be indolent or aggressive            |
| **Age group**            | Common in children and young adults                            | Common in older adults                                  | Common in adults, rare in children                 | Common in middle-aged to older adults                       | Bimodal distribution (young adults and >50 years) | More common in older adults                        |
| **Affected cells**       | Immature lymphoid cells (lymphoblasts)                         | Mature lymphocytes (mostly B cells)                     | Immature myeloid cells (myeloblasts)               | Mature myeloid cells (granulocytes, basophils, eosinophils) | Reed-Sternberg cells (abnormal B cells)           | Malignant B cells, T cells, or NK cells            |
| **Bone marrow findings** | Lymphoblasts >20% of total nucleated cells                     | Lymphocytosis (small, mature lymphocytes)               | Myeloblasts >20% of total nucleated cells          | Increased granulocytes, especially neutrophils              | Not involved primarily                            | Variable, may involve bone marrow                  |
| **Symptoms**             | Fatigue, fever, bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy           | Fatigue, recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy          | Fatigue, bleeding, infections, gum hypertrophy     | Fatigue, splenomegaly, weight loss                          | Painless lymphadenopathy, 'B symptoms"[^1]        | Painless lymphadenopathy, 'B symptoms'[^1]         |
| **Genetic markers**      | t(12;21), t(9;22)[^2] (Philadelphia chromosome in some cases)  | Deletion of 13q, trisomy 12                             | t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17)                         | t(9;22)[^2] (Philadelphia chromosome)                       | CD15+, CD30+                                      | CD20+ (B cells), CD3+ (T cells), varies by subtype |
| **Treatment**            | Chemotherapy, CNS prophylaxis (e.g., intrathecal methotrexate) | Targeted therapies (e.g., rituximab), chemotherapy      | Chemotherapy (e.g., cytarabine, anthracyclines)    | Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., imatinib), chemotherapy   | Chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy            | Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation          |
| **Prognosis**            | Depends on age, genetic abnormalities (better in children)     | Usually good in early stages, poorer in advanced stages | Variable, depends on age and genetic abnormalities | Good with tyrosine kinase inhibitors                        | Generally good, especially in early stages        | Variable, depends on subtype and stage             |

[^1]: **'B symptoms'**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss.

[^2]: **t(9;22)**: Translocation forming the Philadelphia chromosome, common in CML and some cases of ALL.
