# Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

> ITP is immune-mediated with involvement of autoantibodies which sensitise the platelet, resulting in premature removal from the circulation by cells of the reticulo-endothelial system.

## Clinical Features and Investigations

> Depend on the degree of thrombocytopneia.

- In adults: Females > males
- **Platelet count < 20 x 10e9/L**: Spontaneous bleeding
- **Platelet count > 20 x 10e9/L**: Easy bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia
- **Platelet count > 50 x 10e9/L**: Asymptomatics; Discovered by chance
- **Blood film**: Normal except markedly reduced platelet
- **Bone marrow**: Megakaryocytesâ†‘

## Management

### Stable Compensated ITP

- Stable compensated ITP with platelet count > 30 x 10e9/L: `No treatment` required except at times of increased bleeding risk (surgery, biopsy)

### Spontaneous Bleeding

- `First line therapy`: High dose of `glucocorticoids`[^1] (`prednisolone` 1mg/kg daily or `dexamethasone` 40 mg daily for 4 days)
- If first line therapy failed: `IV immunoglobin + glucocorticoid` therapy
- If persistent or potentially life-threatening bleeding: **ADD** `platelet transfusion`

### Relapse

- **One relapse**: Re-introduce `glucocorticoids`
- **Two relapses** or **primary refractory disease**: `Second-line therapies`
  - Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) `eltrombopag` and `romiplostim`
  - Splenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor `fostamatinib`
  - Splenectomy
  - Immunosuppressants (`rituximab`, `ciclosporin`, `mycophenolate`, `tacrolimus`)

<details>
<summary>Indication for splenomegaly</summary>

1. Hypersplenism
1. Symptomatic massive splenomegaly
1. Transfusion requirement > 250 ml/kg/year of packed red cells or > 400 ml/kg/year of whole blood

- Age: > 6 year-old to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis
- Pneumococcal vaccine, meningococcal vaccine, haemophilus influenzae vaccine: 4-6 weeks prior to splenectomy and booster dose after
- Life-long `penicillin` prophylaxis
- Low dose `aspirin` for thrombosis

</details>

<details>
<summary>Management of splenectomised patient</summary>

1. **Vaccinate** with pneumococcal, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B, meningococcal group C and influenza vaccines at least 2-3 weeks before elective splenectomy
1. Pneumococcal **re-immunisation** should be given at least 5-yearly and influenza annually
1. `Life-long prophylatic penicillin V` (500mg twice daily); Consider `macrolide` for penicillin allergic patients
1. **Health education** about the risks of infection and methods of prophylaxis
1. **A card or bracelet** should be carried to alert health professionals
1. In **sepsis**, give IV antibiotics to cover pneumococcus, _Haemophilus_ and meningococcus
1. **Risk of cerebral malaria** is increased in the event of infection
1. **Animal bites** should be promptly treated with local disinfection and antibiotics to prevent serious soft tissue infection and sepsis

</details>

## Prognosis

- Splenectomy produces omplete remission in about 70% of patients
- Low-dose glucocorticoid and Immunosuppressants also produce remission
