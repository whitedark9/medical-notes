# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

- ACS includes both **unstable angina** and **myocardial infarction**.

> Unstable angina is characterised by new-onset or rapidly worsening angina (crescendo angina), angina on minimal exertion or angina at rest in the absence of myocardial injury.

> Myocardial infarction is distinguished from unstable angina by the occurrence of myocardial necrosis.

<details>
<summary>Criteria for acute myocardial infarction</summary>

The term acute myocardial infarction (MI) should be used when there is

1. Acute myocardial injury
   - with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia
   - with detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac **troponin** values with **at least one value above the 99th centile upper reference limit**
1. At least one of the following:
   - Symptoms of myocardial ischaemia
   - New ischaemic ECG changes
   - Development of **pathological Q waves**
   - **Imaging evidence** of new loss of viable myocardial or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology
   - Identification of a **coronary thrombus** by angiography or autopsy

</details>

<details>
<summary>Classification of acute myocardial infarction</summary>

1. **Type 1 MI**: Acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium
1. **Type 2 MI**: An imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute atherothrombosis
1. **Type 3 MI**: Cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new ischaemia ECG changes before cardiac troponin values become available or abnormal
1. **Type 4 MI**: MI caused during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
   - **Type 4a**: Caused by PCI
   - **Type 4b**: Caused by other types including stent thrombosis
   - **Type 4c**: Caused by restenosis
1. **Type 5 MI**: MI caused during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

<details>
<summary>
Arrhythmia in patients with acute coronary syndrome
</summary>

- Adequate pain relief, rest and the correction of hypokalaemia can minimise the risk of arrhythmia
- **Ventricular fibrillation**:
  - Major cause of death
  - Need prompt defibrillation to restore sinus rhythm
- **Ventricular tachycardia**:
  - Need anti-arrhythmic therapy including ICDs
- **Atrial fibrillation**:
  - No need emergency treatment
  - Need anticoagulatants
- **Second-degree or complete AV block**:
  - Consider temporary pacemaker

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Recurrent angina at rest or on minimal exertion after an acute coronary syndrome
</summary>

- Consider `prompt coronary angiography with a view to revascularisation`
- Treat pain with IV glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (`tirofiban` or `abciximab`)
- For patients with resistant pain or marked haemodynamic changes, consider `intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation` and `emergency coronary revascularisation`.
- All patients who have received successful thrombolysis should be considered for early (within 24 hours) `coronary angiography with a view to coronary revascularisation`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Acute heart failure in patients with acute coronary syndrome
</summary>

- It means extensive myocardial damage
- Poor prognosis

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Pericarditis in patients with acute coronary syndrome
</summary>

- Occurs on the second and third days
- Pain worsen or present only on inspiration
- Use: `opiate-based analgesis`
- Avoid: `NSAIDs` and `steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs` (more risk of aneurysm and myocardial rupture)

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Dressler syndrome 
</summary>

> Dressler syndrome is characterised by persistent fever, pericarditis and pleurisy, and is probably due to autoimmunity.

- Occur a few weeks or even months after MI
- Treatment: `High-dose aspirin`, `NSAIDs` or `glucocorticod steroids`

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Papillary muscle rupture 
</summary>

- Presents with acute pulmonary oedema and shock ← sudden onset of severe mitral regurgitation
- Confirmed by **echocardiography**
- `Emergency valve replacement` may be necessary

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Ventricular septal rupture
</summary>

- Confirmed by **doppler echocardiography** and **right heart catheterisation**
- Treatment: `Emergency surgical repair` (without this, it is ~~fatal~~)

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Ventricular rupture
</summary>

- Leads to cardiac temponade (~~fatal~~)
- Treatment: Emergency surgery

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Embolism
</summary>

- MI leads to systemic embolism and occasionally causes a stroke or ischaemic limb

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Ventricular remodelling
</summary>

- Thinning and stretching of the infarcted segment → Progressive dilatation and hypertrophy of the remaining ventricle
- `β-blockers`, `ACE inhibitor` and `mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists` therapies can reduce late ventricular remodelling and prevent heart failure

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Ventricular aneurysm
</summary>

- Heart failure, ventricular arrhythmia, mural thrombus and systemic embolism are complications of aneurysm
- Paradoxical impulse on the chest wall
- Persistent ST elevation on the ECG
- Unusual bulge from the cardiac silhouette on the chest X-ray
- Confirmed by **echocardiography**

</details>

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Investigation

<Tabs items={["Simple", "Details"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. **Repeated Electrocardiogram** (12-lead ECG)
   - Confirm the diagnosis
   - Decide immediate management
1. **Seria measurements of cardiac biomarkers**
   - Troponins T and I
   - Creatine kinase (CK)
   - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   - aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
1. **Chest X-ray**
1. **Echocardiography**
1. **Coronary angiography with a veiw to revascularisation**
1. **Full blood count**: Leucocytosis
1. **ESR**, **CRP**: Elevated
1. **Lipid**, **Cholesterol**

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

- Standard 12-lead ECG to confirming the diagnosis and deciding immediate management
- Repeated ECGs are important
- Earliest change is ST-segement deviation
- In **transmural (full-thickness) MI**, ST-segment elevation + development of Q wave
- In **partial-thcikness (subendocardial) MI**, non-ST segement elevation (partial occlusion of major vessel or complete occlusion of a minor vessel)

| Infarction    | Abnormal leads       |
| :------------ | :------------------- |
| Anteroseptal  | V1 to V4             |
| Anterolateral | V4 to V6, aVL, I     |
| Inferior      | II, III, aVF, I, aVL |

### Cardiac Biomarkers

1. Serial measurements of cardiac troponin concentration
   - In unstable angina: No detectable ris in troponin
   - Level of troponins T and I increases within 3-6 hours, peak at about 36 hours, remain elevated for 2 weeks
1. Full blood count: Leucocytosis
1. ESR, CRP: Elevated
1. Cholesterol: Fall in 3 months following infarction

### Radiography

- To detect pulmonary oedema
- Heart size: Normal but cardiomegaly due to pre-existing myocardial damage

### Echocardiography

- To assess ventricular function
- To detect important complications (mural thrombus, cardiac rupture, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, pericardial effusion)

### Coronary angiography

- Coronary angiography with a view to revascularisation

> In all patients with moderate or high risk of a further event<br/>In patients who fail medical therapy<br/>In patients with extensive ECG changes<br/>In patients with an elevated cardiac troponin<br/>In patients with severe pre-existing stable angina.

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

#### Analgesia

- To relieve distress
- To lower adrenergic drive → Reduce vascular resistance, BP infarct size and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias
- IV opiates (`morphine`, `diamorphine`) and anti-emetics (`metoclopramide`)

#### Reperfusion Therapy

- Immediate Reperfusion therapy with PCI
- If PCI cannot be performed within 120 mins for any reason, the procedure should be performed as soon as practically possible.
- No immediate mortality benefit in patients with non-ST segment elevation ACS

#### Thrombolytic Therapy

- Do when PCI cannot be achieved in ST-segment elevation MI
- Modern thrombolytic agents (`tenecteplase` (TNK) and `reteplase` (rPA))
- Major side effects: ~~Bleeding~~, ~~Cerebral haemorrhage~~
- Even where thrombolysis successfully achieves reperfusion, PCI should be considered within 24 hours to prevent recurrent reperfusion and improve outcome

#### Anti-thrombotic Therapy

- Oral `aspirin` 75-325 mg daily and `P2Y12 receptor antagonist` (`ticagrelor`, `prasugrel`, `clopidogrel`) (for up to 12 months) + IV Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (`tirofiban` and `abciximab`)
- Pentasaccharide (SC `Fondaparinux`) or `Low-molecular-weight heparin` (SC `enoxaparin`)

#### Anti-anginal Therapy

- `Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate` for unstable angina or threatened infarction
- IV `nitrates` (`glyceryl trinitrate` or `isosorbide dinitrate`) for left ventricular failure and recurrent or persistent ischaemic pain
- IV `β-blockers` (`atenolol` or `metoprolol`) to relieve pain, reduces arrhythmias and improve mortality
  - Avoid to use them in heart failure (pulmonary oedema), hypotension (SBP < 105mmH) or bradycardia (HR < 65/min)
- `Verapamil` or `Diltiazem` if β-blockers are contraindicated
- `Nifedipine` or `Amlodipine` for persistent chest discomfort

#### ACE inhibitors

- Long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors (`enalapril` or `ramipril`) can counteract ventricular remodelling, prevent the onset of heart failure

#### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

- `Eplerenone` or `spironolactone` in patients with acute MI and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 35%) and either pulmonary oedema or diabetes mellitus

#### Lipid-lowering Therapy

- All patients should receive HMG CoA reductase enzyme inhibitors (statins)
- `Atorvastatin` or `rosuvastatin`
- If total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol cannot be lowered, add other agents (`ezetimibe`, `fibrates`, a`nion exchange resins` and `injectable PCSK9 inhibitors`)

#### Implantable Defibrillators

- To prevent sudden cardiac death in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < 30%) after MI

### Type-2 MI Management

- No evidence that treatments for type 1 MI are effective in type 2 MI
- _Treat the underlying cause_

## Prognosis

- Depends on the extent of residual myocardial ischaemia, the degree of myocardial damage and the presence of ventricular arrhythmias
- Prognosis is worse for anterior than for inferior infarcts
