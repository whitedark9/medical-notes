# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

## Clinical Problems

1. `Stable angina`
   - **Ischemia** ← fixed artheromatous stenosis of one or more coronary arteries
1. `Unstable angina`
   - **Ischemia** ← dynamic complete or partial obstruction of a coronary artery ← plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed thrombosis
1. `Myocardial infarction (type 1)`
   - **Myocardial necrosis** ← actue occlusion of a coronary artery ← plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed thrombosis
1. `Myocardial infarction (type 2)`
   - **Supply demand imbalance** where blood flow cannot meet the needs of the myocardium ← fixed atheromatous obstruction with high myocardial demand for blood
1. `Heart failure`
   - **Myocardial dysfunction** ← ischemia or infarction
1. `Arrhythmia`
   - **Altered conduction** ← ischemia or infarction
1. ~~Sudden death~~
   - Ventricular arrhythmia, asystole or massive myocardial infarction

## Risk Factors of Atherosclerosis

1. **Age and Sex**
   - Old age
   - Pre-menopausal women have lower risk
1. **Genetics**
   - Family history of atherosclerotic CAD
1. **Smoking**
1. **Hypertension**
1. **Hypercholesterolaemia**
1. **Diabetes mellitus** (especially Type 2 DM)
1. **Haemostatic factors**
   - Platelet activation, high plasma firnogen
   - Antiphospholipid antibodies
1. **Lack of physical activity**
1. **Obesity**
1. **Alcohol**
1. **Diets** deficient in fresh fruit, vegetables and polyunsaturated fatty acids
1. **Social deprivation**

## Management

### 1. Primary Prevention

> Lifestyle changes or therapeutic interventions to prevent CAD and other forms of atherosclerosis in the whole population or in healthy individuals with an elevated risk of disease.

### 2. Secondary Prevention

> Initiating treatment in patients who already have had an event, with the aim of reducing the risk of subsequent events.
