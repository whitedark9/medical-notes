# Pleural Effusion

## Definition

> Accumulation of serous fluid within the pleural space is pleural effusion.

<details>
<summary>Differences between plueral effusion, empyema, haemothorax and chylothorax</summary>

> Accumulation of pus within the pleural space is empyema.

> Accumulation of blood within the pleural space is haemothorax.

> Accumulation of chyle within the pleural space is chylothorax.

## Causes

1. Common (_TB-CHIPS_)
   - Tuberculosis (**TB**)
   - **C**ancer (Malignant disease)
   - **H**eart failure
   - Pulmonary **i**nfarction
   - **P**neumonia ('parapneumonic effusion')
   - **S**ubdiaphragmatic disorders (subphrenic abscess, pancreatitis, etc.)
1. Uncommon (_MARCH UP_)
   - **M**yxoedema
   - **M**eigs syndrome (oarian tumour + pleural effusion)
   - **A**sbestos-related benign plueral effusion
   - Acute **r**heumatic fever
   - **C**onnective tissue diseases (particularly SLE and rheumatoid arthritis)
   - **H**ypoproteinaemia (nephrotic syndrome, liver failure, malnutrition)
   - **U**raemia
   - **P**ost-myocardial infarction syndrome

## Clinical Features

## Investigations

1. **Radiological investigations**
   - Classical appearance on erect PA chest X-ray: Curved shadow at the lung base, blunting the costophrenic angle and ascending towards the axilla
   - Need around 200 mL of fluid to detect on the X-ray
1. **Ultrasound**
   - A clear hypoechoic space is consistent with a transudate
   - The presence of moving, floating densities suggests an exudate
1. **CT scan**
   - Malignant or loculation is suspected
1. **Pleural aspiration and biopsy** (Ultrasound or CT-guided)
   - Biochemical analysis: To classify exudate or transudate
   - Cytological examination: To characterize the presence of inflammatory or malignant cells
   - Microbiological staining: To detect bacteria and mycobacteria
1. **Measurement of Adenosine deaminase (ADA)**: If TB is considered
1. **Video-assisted thoracoscopy**

## Management

### Therapeutic Aspiration

- ~~An effusion should never be drained to dryness before establishing a diagnosis~~
- _Removing > 1.5 L at a time has a small risk of re-expansion pulmonary oedema_
- Management of underlying causes
