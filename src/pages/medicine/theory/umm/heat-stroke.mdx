# Heat Stroke

> A **life-threatening failure of thermoregulation** → **core body temperature >40°C** with **CNS dysfunction** (confusion, delirium, seizures, coma) ± multiorgan failure.

- Caused by inability of heat loss mechanisms to match excessive heat load.

## Types

1. **Classic (Non-exertional)**

   - Elderly, young children, chronically ill
   - Trigger: high environmental temperature/humidity
   - Often during heatwaves

2. **Exertional**

   - Young healthy people during strenuous activity in hot environments
   - e.g., athletes, military recruits

## Pathophysiology

Heat exposure or overproduction
**→** Failure of thermoregulation (sweating, vasodilation)
**→** Cellular protein denaturation & membrane instability
**→** **Endothelial injury + cytokine storm**
**→** Capillary leak **→** **hypovolaemia**
**→** Coagulopathy (DIC) + multiorgan dysfunction (renal, hepatic, CNS)

## Risk Factors

- Age extremes
- Dehydration
- Drugs: anticholinergics, β-blockers, diuretics, phenothiazines
- Cardiovascular disease, obesity
- High humidity (↓ evaporative cooling)

## Clinical Features

**Core temperature >40°C** (rectal probe preferred)

- **CNS**: altered mental state, confusion, seizures, coma
- **Skin**: hot, dry (classic type), may be sweaty (exertional type)
- **Circulation**: tachycardia, hypotension, shock
- **Respiratory**: tachypnoea
- **Other**: nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, oliguria

## Complications

- Rhabdomyolysis → acute kidney injury
- DIC
- ARDS
- Hepatic failure
- Permanent neurological deficits
- Death

## Emergency Management (ABCDEF approach)

1. **Airway**

   - Ensure patency; intubate if GCS ≤8 or airway compromise

2. **Breathing**

   - Oxygen supplementation; monitor SpO₂

3. **Circulation**

   - IV access; isotonic fluids (0.9% saline) for volume resuscitation
   - Avoid overhydration (risk of cerebral/pulmonary oedema)

4. **Disability**

   - Check blood glucose (exclude hypoglycaemia as cause of coma)
   - Treat seizures with benzodiazepines if present

5. **Exposure + Cooling** (**Mainstay of treatment**)

   - **Remove from heat source** (shade, air-conditioned environment)
   - **Rapid cooling** to 38–39°C:

     - Ice-water immersion (best for exertional heat stroke)
     - Evaporative cooling (spray lukewarm water + fans)
     - Ice packs to axillae, groin, neck
     - Cold IV fluids (for exertional cases)

   - Avoid shivering (increases heat production) — use benzodiazepines if needed

6. **Further management**

   - Monitor core temp continuously
   - Monitor U\&E, creatinine, CK, LFTs, coagulation, ABG
   - Treat complications (DIC → FFP/platelets, AKI → dialysis if needed)
   - No role for antipyretics (paracetamol ineffective and potentially harmful)

## Prognosis

- Mortality: 10–80% (depends on delay to cooling)
- Neurological sequelae common if treatment delayed
