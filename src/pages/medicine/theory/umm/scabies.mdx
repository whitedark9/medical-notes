# Scabies

> Contagious parasitic skin infestation caused by the mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_ var. _hominis_, producing intense pruritus and a characteristic rash due to a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to mite antigens.

## Causes / Risk factors

- Direct skin-to-skin contact (most common, prolonged)
- Fomites (clothing, bedding) – less common
- Overcrowded living conditions (institutions, refugee camps)
- Immunocompromised states → higher risk of crusted (Norwegian) scabies

## Pathophysiology

Mite burrows into stratum corneum → lays eggs → hatch into larvae → mature in skin
↓
Mite antigens → delayed hypersensitivity reaction (2–6 weeks after primary infestation; 1–4 days after reinfestation)
↓
Intense itching (worse at night) + rash in characteristic locations

## Clinical features

- **Pruritus** – severe, especially at night
- **Burrows** – thin, serpiginous, grey-white lines with a papule or vesicle at one end
- **Distribution** (classical scabies in adults):

  - Web spaces of fingers and toes
  - Flexor aspects of wrists
  - Axillae, umbilicus, waistline
  - Genitalia (male: scrotum, penis; female: areola)
  - Sparing of head/neck (except in infants & immunocompromised)

- **Secondary lesions** – excoriations, crusting, eczema, impetiginisation
- **Crusted (Norwegian) scabies** – thick crusts, minimal itch, highly contagious, often in immunosuppressed

## Investigations

For diagnosis:

- Usually clinical based on distribution and presence of burrows
- Skin scraping from burrow → microscopy (mite, eggs, or faecal pellets)
- Dermatoscopy → "delta wing jet" sign (mite at end of burrow)

For causes:

- Contact tracing to identify source

For complications:

- Swab for culture if secondary bacterial infection (e.g. _S. aureus_, _Streptococcus pyogenes_)

## Management

**General principles**

- Treat patient **and all close contacts simultaneously** (even if asymptomatic)
- Decontaminate bedding, clothing, towels → wash at ≥60°C or seal in plastic bag ≥72 hrs
- Address overcrowding, hygiene factors

**Medical treatment**

1. **Topical scabicides**

   - `Permethrin 5% cream` – first-line

     - Apply to entire body from neck down (including under nails, soles, genitalia); in infants/elderly, also scalp and face avoiding eyes/mouth
     - Leave for 8–12 hrs, repeat after 7 days

   - Alternative: `Benzyl benzoate 25%`, `crotamiton 10%`, `sulphur in petrolatum` (for infants, pregnancy)

2. **Oral `ivermectin`**

   - For crusted scabies, widespread outbreaks, or treatment failure
   - Dose: 200 μg/kg, repeat in 7–14 days

3. **Symptomatic relief**

   - `Antihistamines` for itch
   - Mild topical `corticosteroids` for eczematous reaction

**Special considerations**

- Crusted scabies → combined oral `ivermectin` + topical scabicide, often repeated multiple times
- Secondary bacterial infection → oral antibiotics as per culture
