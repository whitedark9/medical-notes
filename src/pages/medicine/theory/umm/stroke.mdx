# Ischaemic Stroke

> A 19-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with sudden onset of
> weakness of the right side. On examination, she had a global aphasia, left gaze preference,
> right homonymous hemianopsia, right facial droop, dysarthria, and right hemiplegia. Cardiac
> examination revealed irregularly irregular pulse, BP of 112/70 mmHg, and mid-diastolic
> murmur (grade 3/5). Non-contrast urgent CT brain shows no ICH. What is the possible
> diagnosis, and describe the management plan for her.

## Diagnosis

Acute Ischaemic Stroke due to Cardioembolic Event (likely from Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis with Atrial Fibrillation)

### Points for diagnosis

- **Sudden onset** focal neurological signs → vascular event.
- **Cortical signs**: global aphasia, gaze preference, homonymous hemianopia → large anterior circulation stroke (MCA territory).
- **Irregularly irregular pulse** → atrial fibrillation → high risk of embolism.
- **Mid-diastolic murmur** → rheumatic mitral stenosis → LA enlargement → AF.
- **CT brain**: no haemorrhage → compatible with acute ischaemic stroke.

## Management

> Stroke is a medical emergency!

### 1. Immediate Assessment (ABCDE + Stroke protocol)

- **A**irway: protect if GCS low.
- **B**reathing: O₂ if SpO₂ \<94%.
- **C**irculation: monitor BP (avoid aggressive lowering; permissive hypertension unless >220/120 mmHg or planned thrombolysis).
- **D**isability: NIHSS score to assess severity.
- **E**xposure: look for trauma, rashes (vasculitis signs).

### 2. Confirm Diagnosis & Determine Eligibility for Reperfusion

- **Urgent non-contrast CT**: already done → excludes intracerebral haemorrhage.
- **Assess onset time**: if \<4.5 hrs → eligible for IV thrombolysis (alteplase) unless contraindicated.
- If large vessel occlusion (ICA/MCA) and \<6 hrs (or up to 24 hrs in select cases with favourable perfusion imaging) → consider **mechanical thrombectomy**.

### 3. Acute Treatment

#### A. Reperfusion Therapy

- `IV thrombolysis` (alteplase 0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg): 10% bolus, rest over 60 min.
- `Mechanical thrombectomy`
- Refer to acute stroke unit care

#### B. Antithrombotic Therapy

- If not thrombolysed: start `aspirin 300 mg` after haemorrhage excluded.
- For **cardioembolic stroke**:

  - Delay **oral anticoagulation** to 3–14 days depending on infarct size/severity (to avoid haemorrhagic transformation).
  - Use `DOAC` or `warfarin` (mitral stenosis → `warfarin` preferred; target INR 2–3).

#### C. BP Management

- Only treat if:

  - BP >220/120 mmHg (no thrombolysis)
  - BP >185/110 mmHg (for thrombolysis eligibility)

#### D. Supportive Care

- Maintain normoglycaemia, normothermia.
- Swallow assessment → prevent aspiration pneumonia.
- Early mobilisation with physiotherapy, speech therapy.

### 4. AF Management in Context of Acute Stroke

#### Step 1 – Stroke Prevention Decision: CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score

<details>
<summary>CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score</summary>

| Risk Factor                             | Points |
| --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Congestive heart failure/LV dysfunction | 1      |
| Hypertension                            | 1      |
| Age ≥75 years                           | 2      |
| Diabetes mellitus                       | 1      |
| Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism hx           | 2      |
| Vascular disease                        | 1      |
| Age 65–74 years                         | 1      |
| Sex (female)                            | 1      |

</details>

- In this patient:

  - Stroke/TIA (current) = 2
  - Age \<65 = 0
  - Female sex = 0 (male patient in this case is not female; if female, +1)
  - Hypertension? Not given (assume no)
    → **Score ≥2** → anticoagulation indicated in **non-valvular AF**.
  - However: **This is valvular AF** (rheumatic MS) → anticoagulation **always indicated** regardless of CHA₂DS₂-VASc.

#### Step 2 – Bleeding Risk: HAS-BLED Score

<details>
<summary>HAS-BLED Score</summary>

| Risk Factor                                   | Points |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Hypertension (SBP >160 mmHg)                  | 1      |
| Abnormal renal/liver function (1 each)        | 1 or 2 |
| Stroke history                                | 1      |
| Bleeding history/predisposition               | 1      |
| Labile INR                                    | 1      |
| Elderly (>65 years)                           | 1      |
| Drugs (antiplatelets/NSAIDs) or alcohol abuse | 1 or 2 |

</details>

- High bleeding risk = score ≥3 → not a contraindication but warrants caution & monitoring.

#### Step 3 – When to Start Anticoagulation after Stroke

- Small infarct: start `warfarin` on **day 3**.
- Moderate infarct: **day 6–7**.
- Large infarct: **day 12–14** (reduce haemorrhagic transformation risk).

#### Step 4 – Choice of Anticoagulant

- `Valvular AF (rheumatic MS)` → `Warfarin` (INR 2–3), not DOAC.
- Bridging LMWH generally avoided immediately post-stroke due to bleeding risk.

#### Step 5 – Rate Control (if tachycardic)

- `β-blocker` (e.g., `metoprolol`) or `digoxin` (if LV function preserved).
- Avoid aggressive rate control in acute stroke unless haemodynamic instability.

### 5. Investigations for Cause

- ECG: confirm AF.
- Echocardiography: assess mitral stenosis severity, LA thrombus.
- Carotid Doppler (to exclude additional large artery disease).
- FBC, U\&E, LFT, coagulation profile, lipid profile, glucose/HbA1c.

### 6. Secondary Prevention

- `Warfarin` (INR 2–3) for AF with rheumatic mitral stenosis.
- `Antiplatelet therapy` (`Aspirin` 300 mg at once, 75 mg daily or `Clopidogrel` 75 mg daily)
- `Lower cholesterol` with high intensity statin after checking liver function tests
- `Lower BP` if BP > 130/70 mmHg 1-2 weeks after onset (`Thiazide diuretic`, `ACE inhibitor`, Other agents)
- `Lifestyle modification` (Smoking cessation, Lower salt intake, Lower fat intake, Lower excess alcohol intake, Lose excess weight, Increase exercise)

### 7. Surgical/Interventional

- `Mechanical thrombectomy` for large vessel occlusion.
- `Mitral valve intervention` (percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy or valve replacement) in long-term to reduce embolic risk if indicated.
