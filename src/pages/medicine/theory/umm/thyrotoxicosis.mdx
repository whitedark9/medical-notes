# Thyrotoxicosis

> What are the common causes of thyrotoxicosis? A 35-year-old lady presented with palpitation,
> sweating, loss of weight but increased appetite, and a midline diffuse neck swelling. How
> would you manage this lady?

## Causes

1. Graves' disease
1. Multinodular goitre
1. Solitary thyroid adenoma
1. Thyroiditis:
   - Subacute
   - Post-partum
1. Iodide-induced:
   - Drugs (amiodarone)
   - Radiographic contrast media
   - Iodine supplementation programme
1. Extrathyroidal source of thyroid hormone
   - Factitious thyrotoxicosis
   - Struma ovarii
1. TSH-induced
   - TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma
   - Choriocarcinoma and hydatidiform mole
   - Follicular carcinoma ± metastases

## Diagnosis

> 35-Year-Old Female with Palpitations, Sweating, Weight Loss + Diffuse Midline Neck Swelling → Likely `Graves’ Disease`

## I. Investigations

### A. For Diagnosis

1. **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)**

   - ↓ TSH (suppressed)
   - ↑ Free T4 and/or ↑ Free T3

2. **TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb)** – confirms Graves’ disease
3. **Thyroid scintigraphy** (if diagnosis uncertain) – diffuse increased uptake in Graves’
4. **Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU)** – high uptake in Graves’, toxic multinodular goitre, toxic adenoma

### B. For Causes / Associated Conditions

- Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) & anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (autoimmune profile)
- Blood glucose (autoimmune diabetes screening)
- CBC, ESR/CRP (inflammation, baseline before therapy)

### C. For Complications & Pre-treatment Baseline

- ECG (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia)
- Liver function tests (before anti-thyroid drugs)
- WBC count (before carbimazole/propylthiouracil → agranulocytosis risk)
- Eye assessment (Graves’ ophthalmopathy severity)

## II. Management

### A. Medical (First-line in many young patients)

#### 1. Symptomatic Control

- `β-blockers` (e.g., `propranolol` 20–40 mg TDS) → controls tachycardia, tremor, sweating

  - Avoid in asthma; use `verapamil` or `diltiazem` instead

#### 2. Anti-thyroid Drugs (ATDs)

Two regimens:

- **Titration regimen**

  - `Carbimazole` 15–40 mg/day (divided) → taper after euthyroidism achieved (usually 4–8 weeks) → maintain 5–15 mg/day for 12–18 months
  - `Propylthiouracil (PTU)` 100–150 mg TDS (preferred in 1st trimester of pregnancy)

- **Block-and-replace regimen**

  - High-dose ATD (e.g., `carbimazole` 40 mg/day) + `levothyroxine` 50–150 µg/day after euthyroidism to avoid hypothyroidism swings

- **Monitoring:** TFTs every 4–6 weeks initially, watch for agranulocytosis (sore throat, fever → stop drug & check CBC immediately)

#### 3. Atrial Fibrillation

- `Digoxin` + `β-blocker` + `Anti-coagulants (if no contraindication)`
- Prognosis: Once TSH is normal, 50% of patients get sinus rhythm back.

#### 4. Graves' Ophthalmopathy

- **Require no treatment**, Only supportive
- Smoking cessation
- `Mythylcellulose eye drops` and `gel` (to comfort dry eyes)
- Protection of eyes from wind and bright light
- Mild case: `Oral selenium (100 μg twice daily for 6 months)`
- Severe case: `Glucocorticoids` (sometimes `orbital radiotherapy`)

#### 5. Pretibial Myxoedema

- **Required no treatment**
- `Topical glucocorticoids` for severe case

### B. Radioactive Iodine Therapy (RAI)

- Indication: recurrent disease after medical therapy, intolerance to ATDs, or patient preference (non-pregnant)
- Contraindications: pregnancy, breastfeeding, severe active ophthalmopathy (may worsen)
- Dose: single oral dose (usually 370–555 MBq I-131) → hypothyroidism common long-term → lifelong levothyroxine

### C. Surgery (Subtotal or Total Thyroidectomy)

- Indications:

  - Large goitre causing compression
  - Suspicious nodule or malignancy
  - Patient preference
  - Contraindication to ATDs & RAI

- **Pre-op preparation:**

  - Euthyroid state with ATDs ± β-blockers
  - Potassium iodide (Lugol’s iodine) 5–7 days pre-op → reduces gland vascularity

### D. Special Considerations in Pregnancy

- 1st trimester: `PTU` preferred (lower teratogenic risk than carbimazole)
- 2nd/3rd trimester: switch to `carbimazole` to avoid PTU hepatotoxicity
- Avoid `RAI`

### Precipitating factor

1. **Infection** (in previously unrecognised or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis)
1. **Thyroidectomy** (in an ill-prepared patient)
1. A few days of **Radio-iodine therapy**

### Management [#TS]

<Tabs items={["Davison", "Oxford"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Hydration
1. `Propranolol` (orally 80 mg 4 times daily or IV 1-5 mg 4 times daily)
1. `Glucocorticoids`[^5] (`hydrocortisone` 100 mg IV every 8 hours) **and** `Iodine`
1. `Sodium ipodate`[^6] (orally 500 mg per day )
   - Alternatives: `Potassium iodide` **or** `Lugol's solution`
1. `Propylthiouracil (PTU)`[^7] (orally 200 mg every 4 hours)
   - Alternatives: `Carbimazole` (20 mg every 6 hours)
1. Maintainance: `Carbimazole` **alone** for 10-14 days

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. IV access, fluids if dehydrated, nasogastric tube if vomiting
1. Take blood for: T3, T4, TSH, cultures (if infection suspected)
1. Sedate if necessary (e.g., `chlorpromazine`). Monitor BP
1. If not contraindication, and cardiac output is OK, give `propranolol PO or IV`
   - In asthma/poor cardiac output, use ultra-short-acting β-blockers, e.g. `IV esmolol`
   - Consider `diltiazem` if β-blockers contraindicated
   - **Get help**
1. May need `high-dose digoxin`, give with cardiac monitoring
1. Anti-thyroid drugs: `carbimazole PO or via nasogastric tube`;
   - After 4 hr, give `Lugol's solution (aqueous iodine oral solution)`
1. `Hydrocortisone IV` or `dexamethasone PO`
1. Treate suspected infection, e.g., `co-amoxiclav IV`
1. Adjust `IV fluids` as necessary; cool with tepid sponging ± `paracetamol`
1. **Continuing treatment**:
   - After 5 day, reduce `carbimazole` dose.
   - After 10 days, stop `propranolol` and `iodine`.
   - Adjust `carbimazole`.
