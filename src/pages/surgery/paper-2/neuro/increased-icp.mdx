# Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP)

> **Increased ICP**: Elevation of pressure within the skull above the normal range (normal: 5–15 mmHg in adults), which can compromise cerebral perfusion and lead to herniation if untreated.

## Common Causes

| Category                    | Examples                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trauma**                  | Epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral contusion, diffuse axonal injury |
| **Infections**              | Meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess                                                                   |
| **Space-occupying lesions** | Brain tumors, cysts, hematomas                                                                            |
| **Hydrocephalus**           | Obstructive (aqueductal stenosis), communicating                                                          |
| **Metabolic / Other**       | Hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, cerebral edema from stroke or hypoxia                               |
| **Idiopathic**              | Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)                                                |

## Pathophysiology

- Increase in **intracranial volume** (blood, CSF, brain tissue) → Monro-Kellie doctrine
- Early compensation: CSF displacement, venous blood outflow
- Once compensatory mechanisms exhausted → ICP rises rapidly → decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP − ICP) → ischemia → further edema → herniation risk

## Clinical Features

### Early Signs

- Headache (worse in morning, with coughing/straining)
- Nausea, vomiting (projectile)
- Blurred vision, diplopia
- Lethargy, confusion

### Late / Severe Signs

- Altered consciousness, drowsiness, coma
- Cushing’s triad: hypertension (widening pulse pressure), bradycardia, irregular respiration
- Papilledema (optic disc swelling)
- Pupil changes: unilateral dilation (third nerve compression)
- Posturing: decerebrate or decorticate

## Investigations

- **CT/MRI brain**: Detect mass lesions, hemorrhage, edema, hydrocephalus
- **ICP monitoring**: In severe head injury or ICU setting
- **Fundoscopy**: Papilledema (late sign)
- **Blood tests**: Electrolytes (Na⁺ for osmotic therapy), coagulation profile

## Management

### 1. Initial / General Measures

- **Airway:** Maintain oxygenation (PaO₂ > 100 mmHg)
- **Breathing:** Avoid hypoventilation; mild hyperventilation only in acute herniation risk (PaCO₂ \~ 30–35 mmHg temporarily)
- **Circulation:** Maintain adequate MAP to ensure cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP − ICP, target ≥ 60 mmHg)
- **Head elevation:** 30° to promote venous drainage
- **Analgesia and sedation:** Reduce metabolic demand and agitation
- **Avoid fever:** `Antipyretics`, cooling measures
- **Fluid therapy:** Isotonic crystalloids; ~~avoid hypotonic fluids~~
- **Osmotic therapy:** `Mannitol` or `hypertonic saline` for acute reduction
- **Seizure prophylaxis:** If indicated (post-trauma, post-surgery)

### 2. Surgical Management

#### Indications for Surgery

- Space-occupying lesion causing mass effect (e.g., hematoma, tumor, abscess)
- Refractory ICP (> 25 mmHg) despite maximal medical management
- Acute herniation syndromes
- Hydrocephalus with rapid deterioration
- Penetrating or depressed skull fractures with mass effect

#### Procedures

| Procedure                                  | Definition / Purpose / When Performed                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Craniotomy**                             | Surgical opening of skull to evacuate hematoma, excise tumor, drain abscess, or repair vascular lesion                                |
| **Cranioplasty**                           | Reconstruction of skull defect (usually later after decompressive surgery)                                                            |
| **Decompressive craniectomy**              | Removal of a skull flap to allow brain expansion and reduce ICP; indicated in malignant cerebral edema or severe TBI with mass effect |
| **External ventricular drain (EVD)**       | Catheter into lateral ventricle for CSF drainage and ICP monitoring; used in acute hydrocephalus or refractory raised ICP             |
| **Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt**        | Diverts CSF from ventricles to peritoneal cavity; used in chronic hydrocephalus                                                       |
| **Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)** | Creates an opening in the floor of third ventricle to allow CSF outflow; alternative to VP shunt in obstructive hydrocephalus         |
| **Tumor excision**                         | Removal of intracranial mass lesion to relieve pressure and prevent recurrence                                                        |

#### Pre-Operative Preparations

- Stabilize airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC)
- Correct coagulopathy

- Osmotic therapy to reduce brain swelling before surgery
- Baseline CT or MRI to guide surgery
- Inform ICU team for post-op monitoring

#### Post-Operative Care

- ICU monitoring of ICP, CPP, and neurological status
- Maintain head elevation

- Physiotherapy to prevent complications of immobility

#### Post-Operative Complications
