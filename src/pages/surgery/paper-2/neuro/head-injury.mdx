# Head Injury

## Indications for CT Scan in Head Injury

### **Immediate CT (within 1 hour) if any of the following:**

- GCS ≤ 12 on initial assessment in Emergency Department
- GCS < 15 at 2 hours after injury
- Suspected open or depressed skull fracture
- Any sign of basal skull fracture:

  - Hemotympanum
  - "Panda eyes" (periorbital ecchymosis)
  - CSF otorrhoea/rhinorrhoea
  - Battle’s sign (mastoid ecchymosis)

- Post-traumatic seizure
- Focal neurological deficit
- More than one episode of vomiting

### **Within 8 hours if:**

- Age ≥ 65 years
- History of bleeding/clotting disorder or on anticoagulants
- Dangerous mechanism (fall > 1 m or > 5 stairs, ejection from vehicle, pedestrian vs vehicle)
- Amnesia for > 30 min before impact

## Clinical Features of Head Injury

### History

- Mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating, fall, RTA)
- Time of injury and any loss of consciousness
- Duration of amnesia (anterograde/retrograde)
- Seizures after injury
- Vomiting
- Headache
- Visual disturbances
- Past history: bleeding disorders, medications

### Examination

- **General:** Airway, breathing, circulation (primary survey)
- **Neurological:**

  - GCS scoring (Eye, Verbal, Motor)
  - Pupil size/reactivity
  - Limb power, tone, reflexes
  - Cranial nerve deficits

- **Signs of skull fracture:**

  - Depressed bone fragments (palpable)
  - Basal fracture signs as above

- **Other injuries:** cervical spine, maxillofacial trauma

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **CT head:** Gold standard in acute setting for intracranial bleed, fracture, brain swelling
- **X-ray skull:** Rarely indicated, replaced by CT
- **MRI brain:** For diffuse axonal injury, small contusions (in stable patients)

### For Causes

- CBC, coagulation profile (esp. if on anticoagulants)
- Blood alcohol level (if relevant)

### For Complications

- Repeat CT (6–24 hrs or earlier if deteriorating) to detect delayed hematomas
- ICP monitoring (severe head injury, GCS ≤ 8)

## Complications of Head Injury

- **Immediate (Primary injury):**

  - Scalp laceration, skull fracture
  - Extradural hematoma
  - Subdural hematoma
  - Cerebral contusion/laceration
  - Brainstem injury

- **Early (hours–days):**

  - Cerebral edema → raised ICP
  - Intracerebral hematoma
  - Seizures
  - Meningitis (esp. with CSF leak)

- **Late (weeks–months):**

  - Post-traumatic epilepsy
  - Chronic subdural hematoma
  - Post-concussion syndrome (headache, dizziness, memory loss)
  - Neurocognitive deficits/personality change

## Management of Head Injury

### 1. Initial Resuscitation (ABCDE)

- **A**irway: Maintain patency; cervical spine immobilization
- **B**reathing: Oxygenation, assist ventilation if required
- **C**irculation: Control bleeding, IV fluids (avoid overhydration)
- **D**isability: GCS, pupil reaction, glucose
- **E**xposure: Full examination for other injuries

### 2. Specific Management

#### **Mild Head Injury (GCS 13–15)**

- Observation for ≥ 4–6 hrs
- Discharge if stable, normal CT, reliable home supervision

#### **Moderate Head Injury (GCS 9–12)**

- Admit for observation
- CT brain
- Repeat neuro checks
- Treat raised ICP if present

#### **Severe Head Injury (GCS ≤ 8)**

- Intubation + mechanical ventilation
- ICP monitoring
- Mannitol/hypertonic saline for raised ICP
- Emergency neurosurgical intervention if mass lesion present

### 3. Surgical Interventions

- Evacuation of hematomas (EDH, large SDH)
- Depressed skull fracture elevation
- Decompressive craniectomy (for refractory ICP)

### 4. General Measures

- Head elevation 30°
- Maintain normothermia
- Avoid hypotension (SBP > 100 mmHg)
- Maintain PaO₂ > 100 mmHg, PaCO₂ 35–40 mmHg
- Seizure prophylaxis (7 days in severe cases)

### 5. Rehabilitation

- Physiotherapy
- Cognitive therapy
- Psychological support
