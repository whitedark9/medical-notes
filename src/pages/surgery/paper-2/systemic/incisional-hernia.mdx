# Incisional Hernia

> A protrusion of abdominal contents through a weakness in the abdominal wall at the site of a previous surgical incision.

## Causes

### 1. Patient-Related Factors

- **Poor wound healing**

  - Malnutrition
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Jaundice
  - Immunosuppression / steroid therapy

- **Chronic increased intra-abdominal pressure**

  - Chronic cough (COPD, asthma)
  - Constipation, prostatic obstruction
  - Ascites
  - Pregnancy

- **Age** → elderly have weaker tissue repair
- **Wound infection** → most important single factor

### 2. Operative Factors

- **Type of incision**

  - Midline vertical incisions more prone than transverse incisions

- **Poor surgical technique**

  - Inadequate closure of layers (especially linea alba)
  - Use of absorbable sutures in fascia
  - Large-bite vs small-bite technique errors

- **Emergency surgery** → higher risk compared to elective (poor prep, contamination)
- **Prolonged surgery / contaminated field**

### 3. Postoperative Factors

- **Wound infection** → leads to fascial dehiscence → later incisional hernia
- **Wound dehiscence ("burst abdomen")**
- **Prolonged coughing, straining, vomiting** → increased stress on wound
- **Poor postoperative care** → inadequate support, premature activity

## Management

### General Principles

- Optimize patient condition before surgery → control diabetes, treat chest disease, stop smoking, weight reduction
- Treat constipation, chronic cough, and prostatism (to reduce raised intra-abdominal pressure)
- Skin care if ulceration present
- Control infection if present at scar site

### Non-Surgical Management

- Not definitive; only for poor surgical candidates (elderly, comorbidities, unfit for anesthesia)
- **Abdominal binder or corset** → provides support and symptom relief
- Weight reduction and physiotherapy

### Surgical Management (Definitive)

1. **Primary Suture Repair**

- Indicated only for small defects (\<2 cm)
- Fascial edges approximated with non-absorbable sutures
- High recurrence rate → rarely used now

2. **Mesh Repair** (standard of care)

- **Onlay mesh repair** → mesh placed anterior to rectus sheath
- **Inlay mesh repair** → mesh sutured to defect margins (not preferred, high recurrence)
- **Sublay (retrorectus) mesh repair** → mesh placed between rectus muscle and posterior rectus sheath (preferred, lower recurrence)
- **Intraperitoneal (underlay) mesh repair** → mesh placed inside peritoneal cavity (special coated meshes used to prevent adhesions)

3. **Laparoscopic Mesh Repair**

- Minimally invasive option → intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) technique
- Advantages: smaller incision, less infection, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery
- Disadvantage: requires expertise, cost, risk of adhesions

### Complications of Repair

- Recurrence (lower with mesh, higher with suture repair)
- Wound infection (more in open mesh repair)
- Seroma, hematoma
- Mesh infection (may require mesh removal)
- Chronic pain due to nerve entrapment
