# Graves' Disease

> **Autoimmune hyperthyroidism** caused by `thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI)`, which stimulate TSH receptors → Excess thyroid hormone production.

- Most common cause of **thyrotoxicosis**.

## 1. History

### Symptoms of Thyrotoxicosis

- **General** → Weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating.
- **Cardiovascular** → Palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation.
- **Neuromuscular** → Tremors, hyperreflexia, anxiety, insomnia, proximal muscle weakness.
- **Gastrointestinal** → Increased appetite, diarrhea.
- **Reproductive** → Oligomenorrhea, infertility, gynecomastia (in males).

### Specific Symptoms of Graves' Disease

- **Ophthalmopathy** → `Exophthalmos` (protruding eyes), periorbital edema, diplopia, conjunctival injection.
- **Dermopathy** → `Pretibial myxedema` (thick, waxy skin over shins).
- **Thyroid enlargement** → Diffuse, non-tender goiter.

## 2. Physical Examination

### General Findings

- **Vitals** → Tachycardia, widened pulse pressure, possible atrial fibrillation.
- **Hands** → Fine tremors, warm moist skin, palmar erythema.
- **Neurological** → Hyperreflexia, proximal muscle weakness.

### Thyroid Examination

- **Goiter** → Diffuse, smooth, non-tender.
- **Bruit over thyroid** (due to increased blood flow).

### Graves' Orbitopathy (Eye Findings)

- **Lid lag** (delayed upper eyelid movement on downward gaze).
- **Lid retraction** (staring appearance).
- **Proptosis (exophthalmos)**.
- **Periorbital edema**.

### Dermopathy (Less Common)

- **Pretibial myxedema** → Localized, thickened, non-pitting edema over shins.

## 3. Investigations

### I. Thyroid Function Tests

- **↓ TSH** (Suppressed due to negative feedback).
- **↑ Free T4 and/or Free T3** (Hyperthyroidism).

### II. Autoimmune Markers

- **↑ Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI)** → Specific for Graves' disease.
- **↑ TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb)** → Confirmatory test.

### III. Imaging

1. **Thyroid Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU) Scan**
   - **Diffuse increased uptake** → Graves' disease.
   - **Patchy uptake** → Toxic multinodular goiter.
   - **Low uptake** → Thyroiditis, factitious thyrotoxicosis.
1. **Neck Ultrasound (USG) with Doppler**
   - **Increased vascularity** (hypervascular goiter).

### IV. Other Tests

- **ECG** → Atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia.
- **Blood glucose** → May be elevated (secondary to hypermetabolism).

## Management

### 1. Medical Treatment

import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

<Tabs items={["Simple", "Details"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

1. Anti-thyroid Drugs (`Methimazole`, `Propylthiouracil`)
1. Beta-blockers (`Propranolol`, `Atenolol`)

1. `Total Thyroidectomy`: Removal of both thyroid lobes and isthmus under GA.
1. `Near-TotalThyroidectomy`: Removal of both thyroid lobes and isthmus, leaving < 1 g of thyroid tissue on one side.
1. `Subtotal Thyroidectomy`: Removal of both thyroid lobes, leaving \~4-5 g of thyroid tissue.
1. `Hemithyroidectomy (Lobectomy)`: Removal of one thyroid lobe with isthmus.
1. `Isthmusectomy`: Removal of the thyroid isthmus only.
1. `Completion Thyroidectomy`: Removal of the remaining thyroid tissue after previous partial thyroidectomy.
