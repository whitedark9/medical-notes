# Shock

> A life-threatening condition of circulatory failure leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, resulting in cellular dysfunction and organ failure.

## Management

### 1. Initial Assessment and Resuscitation

#### Airway

- Ensure **patent airway**.
- Consider intubation if GCS ≤ 8 or severe respiratory distress.

#### Breathing

- Provide **high-flow oxygen** via non-rebreather mask.
- Monitor respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.

#### Circulation

- **Control external bleeding**: Direct pressure, tourniquet (if necessary).
- **Monitor vital signs, urine output, and lactate levels**.
- Calculate `Shock index`
- **Two large-bore IV cannulas (14-16G)**:
  - Start fluid resuscitation with `crystalloids` (`Ringer's lactate` or `normal saline`).
  - If no response after 1-2 liters or shock index > 1 → Initiate 2 units of `blood transfusion` (O-negative or cross-matched blood).
  - If ongoing bleeding → **Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP)** (1:1:1 ratio of `Packed RBCs, Fresh Frozen Plasma, Platelets`)

> HR / SBP

0. Normal: < 0.6
1. Mild: 0.6-1
1. Moderate: 1-1.4
1. Severe: ≥ 1.4

</details>

#### Disability

- Assess Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).
- Look for signs of cerebral hypoperfusion (confusion, restlessness).

#### Exposure & Environment Control

- Expose the patient to assess for injuries.
- Prevent hypothermia (warm fluids, blankets).

#### Fluid Resuscitation & Further Management

- Continue fluids/blood as per response.
- **Surgical intervention**:
  - Exploratory laparotomy for intra-abdominal bleeding.
  - Angiographic embolization if indicated.
- **Correct coagulopathy**:
  - If INR > 1.5 → Give `Fresh Frozen Plasma`.
  - If platelet count < 50,000 → Give `Platelets`.

## 2. Definitive Management

- Identify and treat the source of bleeding:
  - **Trauma → Damage control surgery** (e.g., splenectomy, liver packing).
  - **GI bleeding → Endoscopy, embolization, or surgery**.
  - **Ruptured AAA → Emergency repair**.

### Spleenic Rupture

#### Indications for Surgery

<Callout emoji="">

1. Hemodynamically unstable
1. AAST Grade IV-V
1. Ongoing or uncontrollable haemorrhage
1. Failed non-operative management
1. Associated intra-abdominal injuries
1. Peritoneal signs suggesting rupture

</Callout>

<details>
<summary>American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Grading for Splenic Injury</summary>

1. **Grade I**
   - Subcapsular hematoma < 10% of surface area
   - Parenchymal laceration < 1 cm depth
   - Capsular tear
1. **Grade II**
   - Subcapsular hematoma 10-50% of surface area
   - Intraparenchymal hematoma < 5 cm
   - parenchymal laceration 1-3 cm in depth
1. **Grade III**
   - Subcapsular hematoma > 50% of surface area
   - Intraparenchymal hematoma ≥ 5 cm
   - Parenchymal laceration > 3 cm in depth
   - Ruptured subcapsular or intraparenchymal hematoma
1. **Grade IV**
   - any injury in the presence of a splenic vascular injury or active bleeding confined within splenic capsule
   - Parenchymal laceration involving segmental or hilar vessels producing >25% devascularisation
1. **Grade V**
   - Shattered spleen
   - any injury in the presence of splenic vascular injury with active bleeding extending beyond the spleen into the peritoneum

</details>

<details>
<summary>Peritoneal signs suggesting rupture</summary>

1. Abdominal pain
1. Kehr's sign (referred pain to left shoulder due to diaphragmatic irritation)
1. Rebound tenderness
1. Guarding or rigidity
1. Abdominal distension
1. Decreased bowel sounds
1. Hypotension & Tachycardia

</details>

<details>
<summary>If none of above indications exists, medical management</summary>

- ICU monitoring with serial hemoglobin checks and repeat imaging
- Bed rest and restricted activity for 6-8 weeks
- Embolization (if bleeding persists but patient remains stable)

</details>

#### Surgical Management

1. `Splenorrhaphy (Spleen Repair)`
   - **Indication**: _Minor lacerations, stable patient_
   - **Procedure**: Hemostatic sutures, mesh wrapping, or hemostatic agents (e.g., fibrin glue)
1. `Partial Splenectomy`
   - **Indication**: _Localized rupture with salvageable spleen tissue_
1. `Total Splenectomy (Definitive Procedure)`
   - **Indication**:
     - _Major rupture with uncontrollable hemorrhage_
     - _Devitalized spleen_
     - _Patient unstable despite aggressive resuscitation_

## 3. Complications

- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)** → Correct coagulopathy with **FFP and platelets**.
- **Acidosis** → Optimize perfusion and ventilation.
- **Hypothermia** → Active warming strategies.
- **Multi-Organ Failure** → ICU care, mechanical ventilation if needed.

## Splenectomy

### Indications

#### A. Trauma-related

- Splenic rupture not controllable by conservative or splenic salvage procedures
- Iatrogenic splenic injury during surgery

#### B. Hematological disorders

- Hereditary spherocytosis
- Thalassaemia major (selected cases)
- Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) refractory to medical therapy
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (rare, refractory cases)
- Hypersplenism with severe cytopenias

#### C. Neoplastic / Cystic / Infective conditions

- Splenic tumors (e.g., lymphoma with localized involvement)
- Splenic cysts (symptomatic, large, or recurrent)
- Splenic abscess (not amenable to drainage)
- Hydatid cyst of spleen

#### D. Miscellaneous

- Staging laparotomy in Hodgkin’s lymphoma (less common now with imaging)
- Symptomatic splenomegaly causing mechanical discomfort

### Complications

#### A. Immediate / Operative

- Hemorrhage
- Injury to adjacent organs (stomach, tail of pancreas, colon, diaphragm)
- Pancreatic fistula (if pancreatic tail injured)

#### B. Early postoperative

- Atelectasis, chest infection (due to splinting from pain)
- Subphrenic abscess
- Wound infection
- Thrombocytosis → risk of thrombosis

#### C. Late complications

- **Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI)**

  - Severe septicemia due to encapsulated organisms (_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, _Neisseria meningitidis_)
  - Highest risk in children, within first 2 years, but lifelong risk persists

- Immunological consequences → loss of splenic function (impaired clearance of opsonized bacteria, reduced IgM production)
- Thrombocytosis and thromboembolism (portal vein thrombosis, DVT, PE)

### Preventive Measures after Splenectomy

- Vaccination: pneumococcal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b (ideally preoperatively or within 14 days post-op if emergency)
- Lifelong prophylactic antibiotics (penicillin V in children; selected adults)
- Patient education about risk of infection and need for prompt treatment
