# Piles

> Varicosities of the haemorrhoidal venous plexus in the anal canal.

> **Internal piles** – above dentate line (covered by mucosa, painless unless complicated).

> **External piles** – below dentate line (covered by skin, can be painful).

## Causes of Painful Perianal Condition

### 1. Common Causes

- **Acute anal fissure** – tear in anoderm → severe pain during & after defecation.
- **Perianal abscess** – infection of anal glands → throbbing pain, swelling, fever.
- **Thrombosed external hemorrhoids** – sudden onset perianal lump with severe pain.
- **Perianal hematoma** – rupture of perianal vein → bluish tender swelling.

### 2. Less Common Causes

- **Fistula-in-ano with acute inflammation** – painful if infected or blocked.
- **Proctitis** – inflammation of rectal mucosa (infective, radiation, IBD).
- **Trauma** – e.g., straddle injury, iatrogenic.
- **Perianal skin infections** – cellulitis, hidradenitis suppurativa.
- **Anal carcinoma** – pain in late stages or if ulcerated.

### 3. Referred Pain Causes

- **Pelvic inflammatory disease** – may cause vague perianal discomfort.
- **Lower sacral nerve root irritation** – e.g., spinal pathology.

## Clinical Features

### History

- **Bleeding** – bright red, painless, post-defecation, streaking of stool or dripping into pan.
- **Prolapse** – mucosal lump protruding during defecation (in internal piles).
- **Pain** – rare in uncomplicated internal piles, present in thrombosed/strangulated piles.
- **Discharge / soiling** – due to mucus secretion from prolapsed mucosa.
- **Pruritus ani** – from mucus irritation or poor hygiene.

### Physical Examination

- **Inspection** –

  - External piles: skin-covered lumps at anal margin.
  - Prolapsed internal piles: moist, reddish-blue masses.
  - Strangulated piles: oedematous, congested, tender masses.

- **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)** –

  - Internal piles often not palpable unless thrombosed.

- **Proctoscopy** –

  - Dilated haemorrhoidal veins, classification by degree.

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **Proctoscopy** – confirms presence and degree of internal piles.
- **Anoscopy** – for low lesions.

### For Causes (if secondary haemorrhoids suspected)

- **Colonoscopy / Sigmoidoscopy** – to rule out colorectal cancer, polyps, inflammatory bowel disease.

### For Complications

- **CBC** – to detect anemia from chronic blood loss.

# Management

## 1. General / Conservative Measures

_Applicable to all degrees, especially 1st and 2nd_

- **High-fiber diet** → vegetables, fruits, whole grains.
- **Adequate hydration** → ≥ 2–3 L/day.
- **Stool softeners / bulk-forming agents** → e.g., ispaghula husk, lactulose.
- **Avoid straining** during defecation.
- **Regular bowel habits** → avoid prolonged sitting on toilet.
- **Warm sitz bath** → relieves discomfort, improves venous drainage.
- **Local agents** → topical steroids, local anaesthetic creams (short-term for pain/itch).

## 2. Office Procedures (Minimally Invasive)

_Mainly for 1st, 2nd, and some 3rd degree piles — done under outpatient/local anaesthesia_

1. **Rubber Band Ligation**

   - Purpose: cut off blood supply → necrosis → slough → fibrosis.
   - Method: band placed at base of pile above dentate line.
   - Advantages: effective, minimal discomfort.
   - Contraindications: large 3rd/4th degree piles, anticoagulated patients.

2. **Injection Sclerotherapy**

   - Purpose: induce fibrosis and shrinkage.
   - Agent: 5% phenol in almond oil injected above dentate line.
   - Uses: small 1st/2nd degree piles, bleeding control.

3. **Infrared Coagulation / Cryotherapy / Bipolar Diathermy**

   - Purpose: coagulate vessels → fibrosis.
   - Uses: small internal piles.
   - Less common than banding/sclerotherapy.

## 3. Surgical Procedures

_Mainly for large 3rd and all 4th degree piles, or failed office treatment_

1. **Milligan–Morgan Hemorrhoidectomy (Open)**

   - Steps: excision of pile tissue → preserve skin and mucosal bridges → wounds left open.
   - Advantage: low recurrence.
   - Disadvantage: postoperative pain, longer healing.

2. **Ferguson Hemorrhoidectomy (Closed)**

   - Similar to Milligan–Morgan but wounds closed with absorbable sutures.
   - Advantage: faster healing, less postoperative pain.

3. **Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy (PPH – Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids)**

   - Steps: circumferential excision of mucosa/submucosa above piles with stapler → pulls piles upward and reduces blood flow.
   - Best for: circumferential 2nd/3rd degree prolapse.
   - Advantage: less pain, faster recovery.
   - Not for: large external piles or thrombosed piles.

4. **Doppler-Guided Hemorrhoidal Artery Ligation (DG-HAL)**

   - Uses Doppler to identify and ligate feeding arteries.
   - Less invasive, low postoperative pain.

## 4. Management by Degree

| Degree         | Description                         | Preferred Management                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1st degree** | Bleeding only, no prolapse          | Conservative ± sclerotherapy / infrared coagulation               |
| **2nd degree** | Prolapse with spontaneous reduction | Conservative ± rubber band ligation / sclerotherapy               |
| **3rd degree** | Prolapse requiring manual reduction | Band ligation (if small) or hemorrhoidectomy (if large/bulky)     |
| **4th degree** | Permanently prolapsed, irreducible  | Surgical hemorrhoidectomy (open/closed) / stapled hemorrhoidopexy |

## 5. Strangulated / Thrombosed Piles

- **Acute phase**:

  - Analgesics, NSAIDs.
  - Ice packs, sitz baths.
  - Stool softeners, avoid manipulation.

- **Avoid** immediate excision unless necrosis/gangrene present.
- **Definitive**: hemorrhoidectomy after 4–6 weeks (when edema subsides).

## 6. Postoperative Care (for surgical cases)

- Analgesia (NSAIDs, opioids if severe).
- Warm sitz baths after 24 hrs.
- Stool softeners to prevent straining.
- Maintain high-fiber diet and hydration.
- Observe for urinary retention (especially in males).

## 7. Postoperative Complications

- Immediate: bleeding, urinary retention, pain.
- Early: infection, anal stenosis.
- Late: recurrence, incontinence (rare).
