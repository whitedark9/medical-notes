## Causes Of Pain In Right Iliac Fossa (RIF)

### 1. Gastrointestinal Causes

- **Acute appendicitis** (most common)
- Mesenteric adenitis (viral/bacterial infections)
- Ileitis (Crohn’s disease, Yersinia, TB)
- Meckel’s diverticulitis
- Perforated peptic ulcer (pain may track to RIF)
- Diverticulitis (especially caecal)
- Intestinal obstruction (caecal/ileocaecal)
- Malignancy (caecal carcinoma, ileocaecal tumour)

### 2. Urological Causes

- Ureteric colic (stone in right ureter)
- Pyelonephritis
- Urinary tract infection
- Renal tumour (rare, presents late with pain)

### 3. Gynaecological Causes (in females)

- Ruptured ovarian cyst
- Ovarian torsion
- Ectopic pregnancy (ruptured/unruptured)
- Pelvic inflammatory disease (salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess)
- Mittelschmerz (ovulatory pain)

### 4. Other Causes

- Abdominal wall pathology (hernia, muscle strain, rectus sheath hematoma)
- Retroperitoneal pathology (psoas abscess, retrocecal appendicitis)
- Functional/psychogenic abdominal pain

## Causes Of Mass In Right Iliac Fossa (RIF)

### 1. Gastrointestinal Causes

- **Appendicular mass / abscess**
- **Caecal carcinoma** (common in elderly)
- **Ileo-caecal tuberculosis** (ileocaecal thickening, “doughy” feel)
- **Crohn’s disease** (thickened bowel, inflammatory mass)
- **Ileal/caecal diverticulitis**
- **Fecal mass** (faecolith, palpable loaded caecum)

### 2. Lymphatic Causes

- **Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes** (mesenteric lymphadenitis, lymphoma, secondary deposits)

### 3. Urological Causes

- **Pelvic kidney** (ectopic kidney presenting as RIF lump)
- **Hydronephrosis / pyonephrosis of pelvic kidney**
- **Ureteric mass** (rare, tumour or impacted stone with hydronephrosis)

### 4. Gynaecological Causes (in females)

- **Ovarian cyst / tumour** (simple, dermoid, malignant)
- **Tubo-ovarian mass** (due to pelvic inflammatory disease, abscess, TB)
- **Ectopic pregnancy (chronic/organized)**

### 5. Other Causes

- **Psoas abscess** (tuberculous or pyogenic, deep-seated mass)
- **Parietal wall swelling** (lipoma, desmoid, hematoma, sarcoma, hernia)
