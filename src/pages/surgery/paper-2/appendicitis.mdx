# Acute Appendicitis

> Acute appendicitis is an **acute inflammation of the vermiform appendix**, usually due to **luminal obstruction**, and is one of the most common surgical emergencies.

<details>
<summary>Common Causes of Pain in the Right Iliac Fossa (RIF)</summary>

### 1. Gastrointestinal Causes

1. **Acute appendicitis**
   - Most common cause
   - Pain starts peri-umbilical → localizes to RIF
   - Associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever
2. **Meckel’s diverticulitis**
   - Congenital outpouching of distal ileum
   - Mimics appendicitis
3. **Crohn’s disease**
   - Terminal ileitis → chronic or acute RIF pain
   - Associated with diarrhea, weight loss
4. **Mesenteric adenitis**
   - Post-viral lymphadenopathy in mesentery
   - Usually in children
5. **Cecal diverticulitis**
   - Inflammation of a diverticulum in the cecum
   - Less common than sigmoid diverticulitis
6. **Colonic carcinoma (esp. cecal)**
   - Elderly, anemia, weight loss, altered bowel habits

### 2. Gynecological Causes (Females only)

1. **Ectopic pregnancy** _(ruptured or unruptured)_
   - Severe pain, amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding
   - +ve urine β-hCG
2. **Ovarian torsion**
   - Sudden severe unilateral pain, vomiting
   - Enlarged adnexa on imaging
3. **Ruptured ovarian cyst**
   - Acute onset pain, usually mid-cycle
   - Free fluid on ultrasound
4. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**
   - Bilateral or unilateral lower abdominal pain
   - Vaginal discharge, fever, cervical motion tenderness
5. **Mittelschmerz**
   - Mid-cycle ovulation pain
   - Mild, short-lived

### 3. Urinary Tract Causes

1. **Ureteric colic (renal stone)**
   - Colicky pain radiating from loin to groin
   - Hematuria, nausea
2. **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**
   - Dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain
   - Possible RIF pain if lower ureter involved

### 4. Musculoskeletal Causes

1. **Abdominal wall strain or hernia (e.g. inguinal hernia)**
   - Localized pain, may worsen on movement
   - Cough impulse, palpable swelling
2. **Psoas abscess**
   - Fever, back or flank pain, hip flexion deformity

### 5. Others

1. **Referred pain from hip pathology**
   - E.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis
2. **Torsion of undescended testis** _(if testis is intra-abdominal)_

<summary>Differential diagnosis of mass in RIF</summary>

### Gastrointestinal Causes

1. **Appendicular mass/abscess**
   - Post-acute appendicitis (delayed presentation)
   - Tender, firm, localized mass
2. **Ileocecal tuberculosis**
   - Chronic RIF mass, constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats)
   - May mimic malignancy
3. **Carcinoma of the cecum**
   - Elderly, anemia, altered bowel habits
   - Hard, irregular, non-tender mass
4. **Crohn’s disease (inflammatory mass)**
   - Thickened bowel loops, palpable mass
   - History of diarrhea, weight loss
5. **Meckel’s diverticulum (inflamed or tumor)**
   - Congenital, may form mass when inflamed
6. **Actinomycosis**
   - Rare chronic infection → firm woody mass with discharging sinuses

### Lymphatic Causes

1. **Mesenteric lymphadenopathy**
   - Due to lymphoma, tuberculosis, or viral infections
   - May be multiple, mobile, and non-tender
2. **Lymphoma (e.g. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma)**
   - Firm, rubbery mass ± systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss)

### Gynecological Causes _(Females)_

1. **Ovarian mass (benign or malignant)**
   - Cyst, torsion, tumor
   - Irregular menstrual history, mass separate from bowel
2. **Tubo-ovarian abscess**
   - Secondary to PID
   - Tender mass with fever, vaginal discharge
3. **Ectopic pregnancy (chronic)**
   - Tender adnexal mass, positive β-hCG

### Urinary Causes

1. **Distended bladder (in retention)**
   - Globular suprapubic/RIF mass, dull to percussion
2. **Hydronephrosis of right kidney (low-lying or pelvic kidney)**
   - Cystic, ballotable mass
3. **Ureteric stone with perinephric urinoma**
   - Tender, possibly fluctuant RIF mass

### Musculoskeletal/Soft Tissue

1. **Psoas abscess**
   - Deep-seated mass, may cause hip flexion deformity
   - Associated with fever, back pain
2. **Abdominal wall lipoma or hematoma**
   - Superficial, soft/firm mass
   - Moves with contraction of abdominal muscles
3. **Inguinal or femoral hernia**
   - Cough impulse, reducible, can descend into scrotum/labia

### Congenital/Developmental

1. **Mesenteric cyst**
   - Rare, mobile cystic mass
2. **Undescended testis (intra-abdominal)**
   - Especially in young males

## Pathology (Pathophysiology)

### Stepwise progression:

1. **Luminal obstruction**
   - _Faecolith [^2] (hard stool)_
   - _Lymphoid hyperplasia (especially in children)_
   - Foreign body, parasites (e.g. _Enterobius vermicularis_), tumour
2. **↑ Intraluminal pressure**
   - Due to continued mucus secretion with blocked outlet
   - Compresses venous drainage → congestion of wall
3. **Mucosal ischaemia**
   - Bacterial overgrowth (aerobes & anaerobes, e.g. _E. coli, Bacteroides_)
   - Inflammation of entire wall → _suppurative appendicitis_
4. **Transmural inflammation**
   - Neutrophilic infiltration
   - Serosal involvement → peritonitis [^1]
5. **Complications**
   - Gangrenous appendicitis → necrosis of wall
   - Perforation → localised abscess or generalised peritonitis
   - Appendicular mass or abscess

## Clinical Features

### A. Symptoms

1. **Pain** (classic migration pattern):
   - Initially: **Periumbilical** (visceral pain due to midgut origin)
   - Later: **Right iliac fossa (RIF)** pain (parietal peritoneal irritation)
   - Sharp, worsens with movement or coughing
2. **Anorexia** (nearly universal)
3. **Nausea ± vomiting**
4. **Low-grade fever**
5. **Constipation** (sometimes diarrhoea in children)

### B. Signs

1. **Tenderness at McBurney’s point [^3]**
   - 1/3 distance from ASIS to umbilicus
2. **Guarding** and **rebound tenderness**
   - Suggests peritoneal irritation
3. **Rovsing’s sign**
   - Pain in RIF on palpation of LIF (positive)
4. **Psoas sign**
   - Pain on extension of right hip (retrocaecal appendix)
5. **Obturator sign**
   - Pain on internal rotation of flexed right thigh (pelvic appendix)
6. **Fever and tachycardia**

### C. Atypical Presentations

- **Pelvic appendix**: urinary frequency, diarrhoea, suprapubic pain
- **Retrocaecal appendix**: less abdominal tenderness, flank or back pain
- **Elderly**: delayed presentation, higher risk of perforation
- **Pregnancy**: displaced appendix → RUQ pain

[^1]: _Peritonitis_: inflammation of peritoneum, usually due to infection or perforation.

[^2]: _Faecolith_: hardened stool obstructing appendix lumen.

[^3]: _McBurney’s point_: anatomical landmark on right lower quadrant.

## Investigations

### A. Laboratory

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**
   - **↑ WBC count** (usually 10,000–18,000/mm³)
   - **↑ Neutrophils** (left shift)
2. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**
   - Elevated → supports inflammation
   - Used in scoring systems (e.g., **Alvarado score**)
3. **Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine**
   - To assess hydration, renal function pre-op
4. **Urinalysis**
   - Rule out urinary tract infection or renal colic
5. **Pregnancy test (β-hCG)** in females of reproductive age
   - Rule out ectopic pregnancy

### B. Imaging

1. **Ultrasound Abdomen**
   - First-line, especially in children and pregnant women
   - Findings:
     - Non-compressible tubular structure >6 mm in RIF
     - Free fluid, appendicolith
2. **CT Abdomen with contrast** _(gold standard in adults)_
   - Most sensitive and specific
   - Useful in unclear cases
   - Findings:
     - Dilated appendix >6 mm
     - Wall thickening, fat stranding, abscess, perforation
3. **MRI abdomen**
   - Used in pregnancy if diagnosis unclear
   - No radiation exposure

### Key Differences in Management

| Parameter                   | Acute Appendicitis                             | Appendicular Mass                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clinical Status**         | Acute pain < 48–72 hrs, no palpable mass       | Pain >72 hrs, palpable RIF mass                            |
| **Initial Treatment**       | **Immediate appendicectomy**                   | **Conservative management** (Ochsner-Sherren regimen)      |
| **Antibiotics**             | Peri-operative prophylaxis or short-course     | IV antibiotics for 5–7 days                                |
| **Surgery**                 | Urgent laparoscopic/open appendicectomy        | **Interval appendicectomy** after 6–8 weeks (if indicated) |
| **Indications for surgery** | All confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis       | Failure of conservative tx, abscess rupture, peritonitis   |
| **Imaging Role**            | Optional (clinical diagnosis often sufficient) | **Essential** (CT to define mass and rule out malignancy)  |

### A. Emergency Approach

1. **A – Airway**
   - Ensure patent airway, especially if vomiting or altered mental status
2. **B – Breathing**
   - Assess for signs of respiratory distress
   - Supplemental O₂ if needed
3. **C – Circulation**
   - IV access → fluids (normal saline or Ringer's lactate)
   - Monitor vitals, treat shock if present
   - Group and crossmatch blood (if bleeding suspected)
4. **D – Disability**
   - Assess consciousness, pain control
   - IV analgesia (e.g., paracetamol, opioids)
5. **E – Exposure**
   - Examine full abdomen
   - Check for signs of generalised peritonitis or skin changes
6. **F – Fluids**
   - Start IV fluids (especially in vomiting or dehydrated patients)
   - NPO (nil per os) → prepare for surgery

### B. Definitive Treatment

#### 1. Surgical – Appendicectomy (mainstay)

##### Indications

- Confirmed or strongly suspected appendicitis
- Complicated cases: perforation, abscess, peritonitis

##### Types

1. `Open Appendicectomy`
   - McBurney’s incision
   - Preferred in complicated appendicitis
1. `Laparoscopic Appendicectomy`
   - Preferred for uncomplicated cases
   - Faster recovery, less pain, better cosmesis
1. **If abscess/mass present**:
   - Conservative management (`Ochsner-Sherren regimen`) ± `interval appendicectomy` later

#### 2. Non-surgical (selected cases)

- In selected uncomplicated cases, especially if surgery contraindicated:
  - IV antibiotics
  - Observation
  - Consider delayed appendicectomy

### Post-operative Care

- Early mobilisation
- Pain management
- Wound care
- Watch for complications: wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess

### Complications

- **Immediate**:
  - Perforation, peritonitis, appendicular mass/abscess
- **Post-op**:
  - Wound infection
  - Intra-abdominal abscess
  - Adhesive bowel obstruction
  - Stump appendicitis (rare)

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

### 1. Conservative Management (Ochsner-Sherren Regimen)

- 70–85% resolve with conservative treatment
- If worsening or generalized peritonitis → proceed to **emergency surgery**

#### Indication

- **Appendicular mass** without signs of generalized peritonitis or sepsis
- Patient is clinically stable, no features of rupture or abscess formation requiring drainage

#### Components

1. **Nil by Mouth (NPO)**: To rest the bowel and prevent worsening of inflammation
1. **Nasogastric Tube (NGT)**: If vomiting or evidence of ileus
1. **IV Fluids**: Maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances
1. **IV Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., `ceftriaxone` + `metronidazole`) to control infection and reduce inflammation
1. **Monitoring**
   - Vital signs every 4-6 hours
   - Abdominal examination daily
   - Monitor WBC and CRP
   - Assess for any signs of deterioration (fever, pain, sepsis)
1. **Analgesia**: `Paracetamol` or other suitable pain control agents

#### Expected Course

- Clinical improvement within **48-72 hours**
- Reduction in tenderness and mass size
- Fever subsides, WBC normalizes

#### Elective Surgery (Interval Appendectomy)

- Usually considered **6-8 weeks** after conservative management
- Rationale: To prevent recurrence, though increasingly debated in modern practice

#### Failure Criteria (Indications for Surgery)

- Persistent or worsening symptoms
- Signs of abscess formation or rupture
- Development of generalized peritonitis
- Clinical deterioration despite conservative management

#### Complications if Regimen Fails

- Generalized peritonitis
- Appendicular abscess
- Intestinal obstruction
- Sepsis

### 2. Surgical Management (Emergency Appendicectomy)

**Indication**:

- Signs of peritonitis
- Non-resolving/worsening mass despite conservative treatment
- Unstable patient

#### Procedure:

- Open or laparoscopic appendicectomy
- Drainage of abscess if present
- Peritoneal lavage if generalized contamination

#### Post-op Complications:

- Wound infection
- Fistula formation
- Prolonged ileus
- Intra-abdominal abscess

### Complications of Appendicular Mass

- Rupture → peritonitis
- Abscess formation
- Intestinal obstruction (due to adhesion or mass effect)
- Fistula formation
- Missed diagnosis (e.g. cecal carcinoma or ileocecal TB)

### Prognosis

- Good with early conservative management
- Recurrence of appendicitis in 10–20% without interval appendicectomy
- Higher risk of missed malignancy in elderly → consider colonoscopy
