# Obstructive Jaundice

> Jaundice due to mechanical blockage of bile flow from the liver to the duodenum → increased conjugated bilirubin in blood.

## Causes

### 1. Benign causes

> Impaction Infestation Inflammation Injury

- **Choledocholithiasis** → gallstones in the common bile duct
- **Benign bile duct strictures** → post-cholecystectomy injury, chronic pancreatitis
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis** → progressive inflammatory fibrosis of bile ducts
- **Parasitic infections** → _Clonorchis sinensis_, _Ascaris lumbricoides_ (rare in non-endemic areas)
- **Postoperative bile duct injury** → following hepatobiliary surgery
- **Mirizzi’s syndrome** → impacted gallstone in cystic duct compressing common hepatic duct

### 2. Malignant causes

- **Carcinoma of the head of pancreas** → most common malignant cause in adults
- **Cholangiocarcinoma** → intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct cancer
- **Ampullary carcinoma** → at the ampulla of Vater
- **Gallbladder carcinoma** → locally advanced invasion into bile ducts
- **Metastatic lymphadenopathy** at porta hepatis → from stomach, colon, breast, etc.

### 3. Other causes

- **Periampullary diverticulum** → compressing distal bile duct
- **Chronic pancreatitis** → fibrotic stricture of bile duct
- **Pancreatic pseudocyst** → compressing bile duct
- **Biliary atresia** (in neonates)
- **Congenital choledochal cysts** → cystic dilatation of bile duct with compression
