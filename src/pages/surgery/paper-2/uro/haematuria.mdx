# Haematuria

> Haematuria is the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in urine, visible or detected microscopically.

## Causes

### Kidney (Renal causes)

- Renal cell carcinoma (most important surgical cause)
- Wilms’ tumour (in children)
- Angiomyolipoma
- Simple renal cyst rupture
- Polycystic kidney disease (PKD)
- Trauma (renal laceration or contusion)
- Renal infarction

### Ureter

- Urothelial carcinoma of ureter (transitional cell carcinoma)
- Ureteric stone
- Ureteric trauma (iatrogenic, penetrating, blunt)

### Bladder

- Bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma is common)
- Radiation cystitis
- Schistosomiasis (→ squamous cell carcinoma of bladder)
- Bladder stones
- Trauma (e.g. pelvic fracture → bladder rupture)

### Prostate (in males)

- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
- Prostate cancer
- Prostatic trauma (e.g. catheterisation)

### Urethra

- Urethral stricture
- Urethral trauma (e.g. pelvic fracture, catheter-related injury)
- Urethral carcinoma

<summary>Classification of Haematuria</summary>

### A. Based on Visibility

1. **Macroscopic (Gross) Haematuria**
   - Urine visibly red, brown, or tea-colored.
   - Detected without a microscope.
1. **Microscopic Haematuria**
   - Urine appears normal to the eye.
   - RBCs detected only on:
     - Dipstick test
     - Microscopy (>3 RBCs per high power field)

### B. Based on Timing During Micturition

1. **Initial Haematuria**
   - Blood appears **at the beginning** of urination.
   - Suggests source from **urethra**.
1. **Terminal Haematuria**
   - Blood appears **at the end** of urination.
   - Suggests source from **bladder neck** or **prostate**.
1. **Total Haematuria**
   - Blood is **present throughout** urination.
   - Suggests bleeding from **kidneys** or **bladder**.

### C. Based on Origin

1. **Glomerular Haematuria**
   - Originates from **glomeruli** in kidneys.
   - Features:
     - Dysmorphic RBCs (misshapen)
     - RBC casts
     - Often associated with proteinuria¹.
1. **Non-Glomerular (Urological) Haematuria**
   - Originates from anywhere along the **urinary tract** (ureters, bladder, urethra).
   - Features:
     - Normal shaped RBCs
     - Clots may be present.
     - No significant proteinuria.

## Assessment

### A. History

- Macroscopic vs microscopic haematuria?
- Timing: initial, terminal, total?
- Painful vs painless?
- Associated symptoms:
  - Dysuria (painful urination)
  - Fever
  - Flank pain
  - Weight loss
- Drug history (e.g., anticoagulants)
- Recent trauma or vigorous exercise
- Family history (e.g., polycystic kidney disease)

### B. Physical Examination

- Abdominal examination:
  - Palpable bladder or kidney mass
- Genital examination:
  - Urethral discharge
  - Prostate examination (DRE for males)
- Blood pressure:
  - Hypertension suggests glomerular causes.

### C. Investigations

#### Laboratory

- Urinalysis:
  - RBC morphology (dysmorphic → glomerular).
  - Proteinuria.
- Urine culture:
  - Rule out urinary tract infection (UTI)¹.
- Blood tests:
  - CBC: anaemia, infection.
  - Renal function tests (Urea, Creatinine).
  - Coagulation profile.

#### Imaging

- Ultrasound KUB (Kidney-Ureter-Bladder):
  - First-line for stones, masses, hydronephrosis.
- CT Urography:
  - Best for evaluating haematuria if cancer suspected.
- MRI Urography:
  - If CT contraindicated.
- Cystoscopy:
  - Essential for evaluating bladder lesions, especially if painless haematuria.

## Management

### Emergency Management (For Severe or Active Bleeding)

#### A. Airway

- Ensure airway patency.
- Administer oxygen if hypoxic.

#### B. Breathing

- Monitor respiratory rate, oxygen saturation.
- Support ventilation if needed.

#### C. Circulation

- Check blood pressure, pulse.
- Insert two large-bore IV lines.
- Start fluid resuscitation with crystalloids if hypotensive.
- Crossmatch blood for transfusion if haemodynamically unstable.

#### D. Disability

- Assess neurological status (AVPU/Glasgow Coma Scale).
- Monitor urine output (insert urinary catheter if needed).

#### E. Exposure

- Examine whole body for associated injuries.
- Inspect for flank pain, abdominal mass.

#### F. Fluid

- Insert urinary catheter to:
  - Monitor urine output.
  - Perform bladder irrigation if clots obstruct flow (continuous bladder irrigation - CBI).

### Non-Emergency Management

#### A. Specific to Cause

| Cause                         | Treatment                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| UTI                           | Antibiotics (based on culture)                           |
| Stones (urolithiasis)         | Lithotripsy, stenting, or surgical removal               |
| Bladder/prostate/kidney tumor | Surgical excision ± chemotherapy/radiotherapy            |
| Glomerulonephritis            | Immunosuppressive therapy, control of blood pressure     |
| Trauma                        | Conservative management or surgery depending on severity |
| Anticoagulation overdose      | Adjust anticoagulants, consider reversal agents          |

## Complications

- Anaemia due to blood loss.
- Urinary retention from clots.
- Infection (secondary UTI).
- Obstructive uropathy (blocked urine flow).

## Prevention

- Adequate hydration.
- Prompt treatment of urinary infections.
- Smoking cessation (reduces risk of urinary tract cancers).
- Regular follow-up if known renal disease.
