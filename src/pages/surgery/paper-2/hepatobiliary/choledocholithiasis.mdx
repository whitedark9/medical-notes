# Common Bile Duct (CBD) Stones (Choledocholithiasis)

> Presence of gallstones within the **common bile duct (CBD)**—either primary (formed in CBD) or secondary (migrated from gallbladder).

## Clinical Features

1. **Asymptomatic** (especially if incidental finding)
2. **Symptomatic presentation:**
   - **Biliary colic**: Intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain
   - **Jaundice**: Due to bile outflow obstruction → hyperbilirubinemia
   - **Dark urine, pale stools, pruritus**
   - **Fever with chills/rigors** → Suggests **ascending cholangitis**¹
   - **Nausea, vomiting**
   - **Signs of complications:**
     - **Pancreatitis** → epigastric pain radiating to back, elevated lipase/amylase
     - **Cholangitis** → **Charcot's triad**: RUQ pain + fever + jaundice

<details>
<summary>Murphy's Sign</summary>

> **Murphy's sign** is a clinical test used to detect **acute cholecystitis** (inflammation of the gallbladder).

### How to Elicit Murphy's Sign

1. Ask the patient to lie **supine**.
2. Place your hand at the **right upper quadrant (RUQ)**, just below the costal margin at the mid-clavicular line (location of the **gallbladder**).
3. Ask the patient to **inhale deeply** while you apply **gentle pressure**.
4. **Positive Murphy's sign**:

   - Patient **suddenly stops inspiration** or winces due to pain.

### Interpretation

| Result       | Suggestion                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Positive** | Strongly suggests **acute cholecystitis**                         |
| **Negative** | Less likely cholecystitis; consider other causes (e.g. CBD stone) |

### Diagnostic Value

- **Sensitivity**: \~65%
- **Specificity**: \~80–90%
- Best used in combination with **ultrasound** findings

### Murphy's Sign on Ultrasound (Sonographic Murphy’s Sign)

- Reproduction of pain when the **ultrasound probe** presses over the gallbladder
- More specific than clinical Murphy's sign

## Investigations

### 1. History

- Onset, nature of pain
- History of gallstones or cholecystectomy
- Fever pattern (intermittent with rigors → cholangitis)
- Dark urine, pale stools → obstructive pattern
- Past history of pancreatitis

### 2. Physical Examination

- **Murphy's sign**: negative unless cholecystitis also present
- **Icterus (jaundice)**
- Fever, tachycardia
- RUQ tenderness
- **Hypotension, confusion** in **severe cholangitis**

### 3. Laboratory Investigations

- **Liver function tests**:
  - ↑ Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γGT
  - ↑ Conjugated bilirubin
  - Mild ↑ AST/ALT
- **Pancreatic enzymes** (if pancreatitis suspected): ↑ serum lipase/amylase
- **CBC**: Leukocytosis if cholangitis
- **Blood cultures**: If febrile/sepsis suspected

### 4. Imaging

1. **Ultrasound (USG) abdomen**:
   - Dilated CBD (>6 mm in post-cholecystectomy, >8 mm with gallbladder)
   - May see stones (hyperechoic focus with shadowing)
1. **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)**:
   - Non-invasive, highly sensitive for CBD stones
1. **Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)**:
   - Useful if MRCP inconclusive
1. **ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography)**:
   - Gold standard for diagnosis + **therapeutic**
1. **CT scan**: Less sensitive, but may help rule out complications (e.g. pancreatitis)

## Management

### A. If asymptomatic and incidental

- May observe if:
  - No CBD dilation
  - No deranged LFTs
  - No cholangitis/pancreatitis

### B. Symptomatic or complicated stones

#### 1. Endoscopic Management (First-line)

- **ERCP with stone extraction**:
  - Sphincterotomy ± stone retrieval with basket or balloon
  - Placement of biliary stent if inflammation or residual stones
- Indicated in:
  - Cholangitis
  - Obstructive jaundice
  - Stones seen on imaging

#### 2. Surgical Management

**Indications for surgery:**

- ERCP failure or contraindication
- Large/impacted stones
- Stones with biliary stricture
- Associated gallbladder stones needing cholecystectomy

**Procedures:**

1. **Laparoscopic CBD exploration (LCBDE)**:
   - With cholecystectomy if gallbladder still present
1. **Open CBD exploration**: If laparoscopic fails or anatomy complex
1. **T-tube drainage** may be used post-op

#### 3. Post-operative Management

- Monitor for bile leak, pancreatitis, cholangitis
- Follow-up imaging if residual stones suspected
- Consider repeat ERCP if symptoms recur

### Complications

- **Acute cholangitis**
- **Acute pancreatitis**
- **Secondary biliary cirrhosis**
- **Biliary stricture**
- **Sepsis**

### Prognosis

- Good with timely intervention
- Delayed treatment → ↑ risk of sepsis, liver damage

[^1] **Ascending cholangitis** = infection of bile ducts due to obstruction → bacterial overgrowth → sepsis.
