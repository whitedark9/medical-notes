## Classification of Abdominal Injury

### 1. Based on **mechanism of injury**

#### A. Blunt abdominal injury

- Common causes: road traffic accidents, falls, assaults
- Mechanisms: compression, deceleration, crush
- Commonly injured organs:

  - Solid → spleen, liver, kidneys
  - Hollow → small bowel, bladder (less common)
  - Others → retroperitoneum, diaphragm

#### B. Penetrating abdominal injury

- Caused by stab wounds, gunshot wounds, impalement
- Types:

  - Stab wound (low energy, predictable track)
  - Gunshot wound (high energy, cavitation, unpredictable path)

- Commonly injured: bowel, liver, major vessels

### 2. Based on **anatomical location**

- **Abdominal wall injury**

  - Contusion, laceration, muscle rupture, rectus sheath hematoma

- **Intraperitoneal injury**

  - Solid organs: liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas
  - Hollow organs: stomach, small intestine, colon, bladder
  - Mesentery and vessels

- **Retroperitoneal injury**

  - Duodenum (2nd–4th parts)
  - Pancreas
  - Kidneys, ureters
  - Aorta, IVC

- **Diaphragmatic injury**

  - Often left-sided after blunt/penetrating trauma

### 3. Based on **pathophysiology**

- **Solid organ injury**

  - Laceration, contusion, subcapsular hematoma, rupture

- **Hollow viscus injury**

  - Perforation, contusion, intramural hematoma

- **Vascular injury**

  - Hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula

### 4. Based on **clinical course**

- **Closed injuries** (blunt) → insidious presentation, may be missed initially
- **Open injuries** (penetrating) → obvious wound, risk of evisceration, peritonitis
- **Combined injuries** → e.g., blast injury (penetrating + blunt + burn)
