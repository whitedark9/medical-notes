# Lipoma

> Lipoma = a **benign tumor of mature adipose tissue**, usually presenting as a soft, slow-growing, painless, subcutaneous swelling. It is the most common benign mesenchymal tumor.

## Pathology

- Composed of mature adipocytes enclosed in a thin fibrous capsule
- Can occur anywhere fat is present (common in trunk, shoulder, neck, extremities)
- Rarely undergoes malignant transformation (into liposarcoma)
- Variants: fibrolipoma, angiolipoma, myxolipoma, intramuscular lipoma

## Clinical Features

- Age: typically adults (40–60 years), more in men
- **Swelling**: soft, lobulated, well-circumscribed, subcutaneous, painless
- **Mobility**: slips under fingers (“slip sign”)
- Usually small (\<5 cm), but can grow to giant lipomas (>10 cm)
- Overlying skin: normal, not fixed
- Multiple lipomas → associated with familial multiple lipomatosis, neurofibromatosis, Madelung’s disease

## Differential Diagnosis

- Sebaceous cyst (fluctuant, punctum, not lobulated)
- Neurofibroma (firm, not lobulated, “buttonhole sign”)
- Cold abscess (fluctuant, tender, may have sinus)
- Liposarcoma (rapidly enlarging, deep, painful, irregular)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- Clinical diagnosis is usually sufficient
- Ultrasound → homogenous, hyperechoic, well-circumscribed mass
- MRI/CT → if deep-seated, retroperitoneal, or intramuscular (to exclude liposarcoma)
- FNAC/biopsy → when diagnosis is uncertain or malignancy suspected

### For Causes

- Genetic studies (rarely needed, in syndromic cases like multiple lipomatosis)

### For Complications

- Not usually required; only if recurrent or rapidly enlarging mass (rule out sarcoma)

## Management

- **Observation**: if small, asymptomatic, no cosmetic concern
- **Surgical excision** (treatment of choice):

  - Indications: cosmetic disfigurement, pain, pressure symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty, rapid growth, large/giant lipoma
  - Complete excision with capsule → prevents recurrence

- **Liposuction**: alternative in selected cases (not commonly done, higher recurrence)

## Complications

- Rare → recurrence if incomplete excision
- Infection (post-surgical)
- Malignant transformation to liposarcoma (extremely rare)
