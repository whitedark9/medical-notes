# Multinodular Goiter

## Classification of Goiter

### 1. Based on Functional Status

1. **Euthyroid goiter** → Normal thyroid hormone levels.
1. **Hypothyroid goiter** → Decreased thyroid hormone production.
1. **Hyperthyroid goiter** → Excess thyroid hormone production (`toxic goiter`).

### 2. Based on Morphology

1. **Diffuse goiter** → Uniform enlargement of the thyroid.
1. **Nodular goiter** → Focal enlargement with nodules.
   - **Uninodular goiter** (single nodule).
   - **Multinodular goiter** (multiple nodules).

### 3. Based on Etiology

1. **Simple (non-toxic) goiter** → No inflammation, no malignancy, normal thyroid function.
1. **Toxic goiter** → Associated with thyrotoxicosis.
1. **Inflammatory goiter** → Due to thyroiditis.
1. **Neoplastic goiter** → Due to benign or malignant tumors.

## Pathophysiology

- Long-standing multinodular goiter → mutations in TSH receptor / G-protein signaling → some nodules become autonomous ("toxic")
- Excess thyroid hormone secretion **independent of TSH regulation**
- Suppressed TSH → normal thyroid tissue becomes inactive → only toxic nodules function
- Leads to **thyrotoxicosis** (without ophthalmopathy of Graves’ disease)

## Clinical Features

### General Thyrotoxicosis Features

- Weight loss despite good appetite
- Heat intolerance, sweating
- Palpitations, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (common in elderly)
- Tremor, anxiety, irritability, insomnia
- Muscle weakness, fatigue
- Increased bowel frequency

### Specific to TMNG

- Long history of multinodular goiter
- Enlarged, **nodular, irregular thyroid gland** (asymmetrical, firm)
- Often no eye signs (unlike Graves’ disease)
- Pressure symptoms from large goiter: dysphagia, dyspnoea, hoarseness, stridor
- Elderly → “apathetic thyrotoxicosis” (weight loss, cardiac features dominate, less obvious hyperactivity)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- Thyroid function tests:

  - ↓ TSH
  - ↑ T3, ↑ T4

- Radionuclide thyroid scan: patchy uptake in multiple nodules, suppressed uptake in rest of gland

### For Causes

- Ultrasound neck → multinodular goiter with dominant nodules
- Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) → to rule out malignancy if suspicious nodule present

### For Complications

- ECG → atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmias
- Chest X-ray / CT neck → tracheal compression, retrosternal extension
- Serum calcium (if planning surgery → baseline for hypocalcemia risk post-thyroidectomy)

## Management

### 1. Medical

- **Antithyroid drugs** (`carbimazole`, `methimazole`, `propylthiouracil`)

  - Useful for temporary control or pre-operative preparation

- **Beta-blockers** (`propranolol`, `atenolol`) for symptom control
- Not curative (recurrence is common)

### 2. Radioactive Iodine Therapy (RAI)

- Definitive therapy in elderly/unfit for surgery
- Causes gradual gland shrinkage and control of hyperthyroidism
- May require repeated doses
- Contraindicated in pregnancy, lactation, very large goiters with compression

### 3. Surgery (Definitive in large goiters/pressure symptoms)

- `Total or near-total thyroidectomy` is treatment of choice
- Indications:

  - Very large goiter / compressive symptoms
  - Suspicious or malignant nodule
  - Contraindication to RAI
  - Younger patient desiring definitive treatment

### Preoperative preparation:

- Render euthyroid with antithyroid drugs + β-blockers
- Lugol’s iodine or potassium iodide (7–10 days before surgery) → decreases vascularity and hormone release

## Complications

- Hyperthyroid crisis (thyroid storm) if untreated
- Cardiac complications → atrial fibrillation, heart failure
- Tracheal compression, dysphagia from goiter
- Malignant transformation (rare)
