# DU Perforation

## Pathophysiology

Duodenal ulcer → erosion through serosa → leakage of acid + bile + enzymes → chemical peritonitis (first few hours) → secondary bacterial peritonitis (after 6–12 hrs) → sepsis, shock, multi-organ failure if untreated.

## Emergency Management (ABCDEF Approach)

### A – Airway

- Ensure patent airway
- Give high-flow oxygen

### B – Breathing

- Assess respiratory rate, SpO₂
- Oxygen supplementation

### C – Circulation

- Large-bore IV access (2 wide-bore cannulae)
- Resuscitation with crystalloids (Ringer’s lactate/normal saline)
- Cross-match blood (may need transfusion)
- Monitor BP, HR, urine output (insert Foley catheter)
- IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (cover gram-negatives + anaerobes: ceftriaxone + metronidazole, or piperacillin-tazobactam)
- IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion

### D – Disability

- Assess mental status (for sepsis/ shock signs)

### E – Exposure

- Complete abdominal exam
- NG tube insertion → decompress stomach

### F – Further steps

- Prepare for **urgent surgery** once resuscitated

## Definitive Surgical Management

Choice depends on: ulcer site, size, contamination, patient condition.

### 1. Standard Operation (Most common)

- `Graham’s omental patch repair` (omentopexy)

  - Perforation closed with sutures and covered with pedicled omental patch

### 2. Alternatives

- `Simple closure with omentoplasty` (for small perforations)
- **Definitive ulcer surgery (rare in emergency now, done in selected cases)**

  - `Truncal vagotomy` + `pyloroplasty`
  - `Antrectomy` + `vagotomy` (if large/giant ulcer, recurrent perforation, or suspicion of malignancy)

- `Laparoscopic repair` (minimally invasive option in stable patients)

## Postoperative Management

- IV fluids and electrolytes → gradual oral intake once bowel function returns
- Continue IV antibiotics (5–7 days or until sepsis resolves)
- Continue IV → oral PPI therapy
- H. pylori eradication therapy after recovery
- Monitor for complications: leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, wound infection, sepsis

## Lifestyle & Long-term Measures

- H. pylori eradication (PPI + amoxicillin + clarithromycin/metronidazole)
- Avoid NSAIDs, smoking, alcohol
- Regular follow-up endoscopy in high-risk/older patients
- Nutritional counseling and stress reduction

## Complications if Untreated

- Peritonitis → septic shock
- Multi-organ failure
- Intra-abdominal abscess, fistula, adhesion obstruction
- High mortality if delayed >24 hrs
