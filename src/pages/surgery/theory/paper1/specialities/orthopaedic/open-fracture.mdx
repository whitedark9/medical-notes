# Open Fracture (Compound Fracture)

> An **open fracture** is a bone fracture with **communication between the fracture site and the external environment** through a **disruption of the skin and soft tissue** → high risk of **infection, non-union, and other complications**.

## Features

- Break in skin overlying fracture
- Exposure to contamination
- Requires **urgent debridement and stabilization**

## Classification of Open Fractures

### 1. Gustilo-Anderson Classification (Most commonly used)

Based on:

1. Size of wound
1. Degree of contamination
1. Extent of soft tissue damage
1. Fracture pattern

| Type    | Description                                  | Features                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **I**   | Clean wound < 1 cm                           | Minimal soft tissue damage, simple fracture         |
| **II**  | Wound 1–10 cm, no extensive soft tissue loss | Moderate contamination, no flaps/avulsions          |
| **III** | Wound >10 cm or extensive damage             | High-energy trauma, contamination, complex fracture |

#### Type III subtypes:

- **III A**: Extensive soft tissue damage but **adequate coverage** of bone
- **III B**: Extensive soft tissue loss with **periosteal stripping**, requires **flap coverage**
- **III C**: Any open fracture with **arterial injury** requiring repair

### 2. AO/OTA Classification (optional, used with Gustilo)

Describes fracture location and morphology; **not specific to open fractures**, but used **alongside Gustilo** to guide surgical approach.

## Clinical Importance of Gustilo Classification

Determines:

- Need for **antibiotics** (type and duration)
- **Timing of surgery**
- **Stabilization technique**
- **Need for plastic surgery input** (in Type III B/C)

### Example Application:

- A **5 cm wound** over tibia with **no periosteal stripping** → **Type II**
- A **12 cm wound**, bone exposed, requires **muscle flap** → **Type III B**
- Same case **with arterial injury** → **Type III C**

## Management

### Emergency Management

1. A - Airway
   - Ensure airway patency, cervical spine protection if needed
1. B - Breathing
   - Assess for chest injuries, oxygen support if required
1. C - Circulation
   - Control hemorrhage (direct pressure, tourniquet if life-threatening)
   - IV fluids ± blood products
   - Immobilize fracture to prevent further vascular injury
1. D - Disability
   - Assess neurovascular status distal to fracture
   - Pain control (IV opioids preferred)
1. E - Exposure
   - Completely expose and inspect injury
   - Photograph wound (before covering)
   - Cover with **sterile saline-soaked dressing**
1. F - Fluid & Further planning
   - Start **IV broad-spectrum antibiotics** (within 1 hour!)
   - e.g., `cefuroxime` or `cefazolin` ± `metronidazole` for contaminated wounds
   - Tetanus prophylaxis: `Tetanus toxoid` + `Tetanus immunoglobulin` if status unknown and dirty wound

### Definitive Management

#### A. Initial Surgical Intervention ("The 6-hour rule" is outdated but early debridement remains best practice)

##### 1. Surgical Debridement

- Remove all devitalized tissue (bone, muscle, skin)
- Copious irrigation (at least 6–9 L for Type III fractures)
- Assess wound using **"4 Cs" of muscle viability**:
  - **Color, Consistency, Contractility, Capillary bleeding**

##### 2. Stabilization

- Temporary: **External fixator** (especially for Type III)
- Definitive:
  - **Internal fixation** (if clean, well-perfused, Type I/II)
  - **External fixation** (preferred in high-energy or contaminated wounds)

##### 3. Wound Coverage

- **Type I/II**: Primary closure
- **Type III A**: Delayed primary closure or split skin graft
- **Type III B**: Requires **plastic surgery** (flaps: rotational or free)
- **Type III C**: **Vascular repair** + soft tissue coverage

#### B. Antibiotics Protocol (UK BOAST guidelines)

- **Type I/II**: 1st-gen cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin)
- **Type III**: Add **aminoglycoside** (e.g., gentamicin)
- **Gross contamination** (farm injuries): Add **metronidazole or penicillin**

Duration:

- IV for 48–72 hrs or until soft tissue closure
- Switch to oral based on contamination and healing

#### C. Monitoring and Follow-up

- Watch for signs of infection, non-union, neurovascular compromise
- Serial wound inspections if delayed closure
- Physiotherapy as fracture allows

## Complications

- **Infection** (osteomyelitis, soft tissue)
- **Non-union/malunion**
- **Chronic pain**
- **Compartment syndrome**
- **Neurovascular damage**
- **Amputation** (especially in Type III C)

## Prognosis

- Depends on:

  - Time to antibiotics & surgery
  - Fracture type (Gustilo grade)
  - Degree of contamination
  - Associated vascular injury

## Summary Table

| Gustilo Type | Antibiotics                | Fixation          | Closure                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Type I       | `Cefazolin`                | Internal          | Primary                |
| Type II      | `Cefazolin`                | Internal/External | Primary/Delayed        |
| Type III A   | `Cefazolin` + `Gentamicin` | Usually External  | Delayed/Flap           |
| Type III B   | Add `Metronidazole`        | External          | Flap required          |
| Type III C   | Add `Metronidazole`        | External          | Flap + Vascular Repair |
