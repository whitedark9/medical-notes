# Flail Chest

> Fracture of **≥3 consecutive ribs in ≥2 places** → free-floating segment of chest wall → **paradoxical chest movement** and **respiratory compromise**

## Emergency Management

### Airway

- Ensure **airway patency**
- Consider **intubation** if:
  - GCS < 8
  - Inadequate ventilation
  - Associated head injury

### Breathing

- **High-flow oxygen**
- Monitor SpO₂, RR, ABG
- Treat associated injuries:
  - **Pneumothorax** → chest tube
  - **Pulmonary contusion** → O₂, avoid fluid overload

### Circulation

- Control external bleeding
- IV access → fluid resuscitation if hypotensive
- Blood transfusion if necessary

### Disability

- Assess neurological status (GCS, AVPU)
- Rule out associated spinal trauma

### Exposure

- Expose to inspect chest wall
- Identify paradoxical movement, bruising, crepitus

### Fluids

- Avoid fluid overload (especially if pulmonary contusion present)
- Use minimal crystalloids; prefer blood products if needed

## Definitive Management

### 1. Analgesia (most important step)

- **Goals**: prevent hypoventilation → reduce risk of pneumonia, respiratory failure
- Options:
  - **IV opioids**
  - **Epidural analgesia** (effective with fewer systemic effects)
  - **Paravertebral nerve blocks**
  - **Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)**

### 2. Oxygenation and Ventilation Support

- **Supplemental oxygen**
- **Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)**: CPAP or BiPAP if patient conscious and cooperative
- **Mechanical ventilation**:
  - Indications:
    - Severe respiratory distress
    - Significant pulmonary contusion
    - Failure of NIV
    - Associated injuries needing ventilation

### 3. Surgical Fixation of Rib Fractures

- **Indications**:
  - Flail segment causing paradoxical movement with respiratory compromise
  - Failure to wean from ventilation
  - Severe displacement or rib instability
- **Procedure**: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with plates

### 4. Pulmonary Care

- Chest physiotherapy
- Incentive spirometry
- Early mobilization
- Deep breathing exercises

## Complications

- Respiratory failure
- Pneumonia
- ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)\*
- Chronic pain
- Non-union or malunion of ribs

## Prognosis

- Depends on:
  - Extent of lung contusion
  - Age and comorbidities
  - Timeliness of management
- Mortality ↑ with associated injuries (e.g., pulmonary contusion, head trauma)
