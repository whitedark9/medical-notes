# Blood Transfusion

> Blood components therapy is administration of specific blood components (not whole blood) to correct deficiencies.

## Blood and Blood Products

1. Whole blood
1. Packed red cells
1. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP)
1. Cryoprecipitate (FFP rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, XIII)
1. Platelets
1. Prothrombin complex concentrates (Factor II, IX, X)
1. Autologous blood[^1]

[^1]: Autologous blood: Patient's own blood is collected 3 weeks before operation and is re-transfused during the operation

<details>
<summary>Indication for blood transfusion</summary>

1. Acute blood loss: To replace circulating volume and maintain oxygen delivery
1. Peri-operative anaemia (`Hb < 6 g/dL`): To ensure adequate oxygen delivery during the perioperative phase
1. Symptomatic chronic anaemia, without haemorrhage or impending surgery

## Complications of Blood Transfusion

1. Acute Complications (_FAT BAT_)
   - `F`ebrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)
   - `A`cute Hemolytic Reaction
   - `T`ransfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)
   - `B`acterial Contamination
   - `A`llergic Reactions
   - `T`ransfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)
2. Delayed Complications (_DIG PIC_)
   - `D`elayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR)
   - `I`ron Overload
   - `G`raft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)
   - Hyperkalemia (`P`otassium)
   - Transfusion-Transmitted `I`nfections
   - Hypocalcemia (`C`alcium)

### Acute Complications (< 24 hours)

#### 1. Acute Hemolytic Reaction

- **Cause**: ABO incompatibility.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, back pain, hemoglobinuria, hypotension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Immune-mediated destruction of donor RBCs → hemolysis → release of hemoglobin (`Hemoglobinuria`) and other intracellular contents → systemic inflammatory response → `Fever`, `Chills`, `Back pain`
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~ immediately, supportive care, fluids, `diuretics` to prevent renal failure.

#### 2. Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)

- **Cause**: Cytokines or leukocyte antibodies in donor blood.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills without hemolysis.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~ temporarily, `antipyretics`, restart if symptoms resolve.

#### 3. Allergic Reactions

- **Cause**: Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins.
- **Symptoms**: Urticaria, itching, anaphylaxis (rare).
- **Management**: `Antihistamines`, `corticosteroids`, `epinephrine` if anaphylaxis.

#### 4. Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

- **Cause**: Antibodies in donor plasma react with recipient's leukocytes.
- **Symptoms**: Acute respiratory distress, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- **Pathophysiology**: Antibodies → activation of recipient leukocytes → release of inflammatory mediators → lung injury.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~, supportive care (oxygen, mechanical ventilation if needed).

#### 5. Transfusion-Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO)

- **Cause**: Rapid transfusion or transfusion volume exceeding the circulatory capacity.
- **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, hypertension, pulmonary edema.
- **Management**: _Slow transfusion_ rate, `diuretics`, oxygen therapy.

#### 6. Bacterial Contamination

- **Cause**: Contaminated blood products.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, septic shock.
- **Management**: ~~Stop transfusion~~, broad-spectrum `antibiotics`, supportive care.

### Delayed Complications (> 24 hours)

#### 1. Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR)

- **Cause**: Anamnestic antibody response to a previously encountered antigen.
- **Symptoms**: Mild fever, jaundice, falling hemoglobin levels.
- **Management**: Monitoring, supportive care, possible re-transfusion if anemia is severe.

#### 2. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD)

- **Cause**: Donor T-cells attack recipient's tissues.
- **Symptoms**: Fever, rash, liver dysfunction, pancytopenia.
- **Management**: Irradiation of blood products to prevent, supportive care.

#### 3. Iron Overload

- **Cause**: Repeated transfusions, particularly in chronic transfusion-dependent patients.
- **Symptoms**: Organ dysfunction (heart, liver, pancreas).
- **Management**: Iron chelation therapy (e.g., `deferoxamine`).

#### 4. Transfusion-Transmitted Infections

- **Cause**: Transmission of infectious agents (e.g., HIV, HCV, HBV).
- **Management**: Screening of blood donors, monitoring, and treatment if infection occurs.

### Other Complications

#### 1. Hyperkalemia

- **Cause**: Leakage of potassium from stored RBCs.
- **Management**: Monitoring of potassium levels, correction with `calcium gluconate` or `insulin`.

#### 2. Hypocalcemia

- **Cause**: Citrate in transfused blood binds calcium.
- **Management**: Calcium supplementation if symptomatic.
