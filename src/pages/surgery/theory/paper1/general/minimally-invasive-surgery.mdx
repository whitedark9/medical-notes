# Minimally Invasive Surgery (Minimal Access Surgery)

> Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) refers to surgical techniques that use small incisions with the aid of cameras, scopes, and specialized instruments.

It includes:

- **Laparoscopic surgery** (abdomen & pelvis).
- **Thoracoscopic surgery** (chest).
- **Endoscopic surgery** (digestive/urinary tract).
- **Robotic-assisted surgery**.

## Types

> Scope Assist Per Micro

1. **Laparo`scop`ic Surgery**: Uses a camera and small instruments through small abdominal incisions.
1. **Endo`scop`ic Surgery**: Uses natural body openings (e.g., GI tract, lungs) for access.
1. **Robotic-`Assist`ed Surgery**: Enhances precision with robotic arms controlled by a surgeon.
1. **Video-`Assist`ed Surgery (VATS)**: Used in thoracic procedures with camera-guided access.
1. **`Per`cutaneous Surgery**: Needle-based interventions (e.g., catheterization, biopsy).
1. **`Micro`surgery**: High-magnification surgery for delicate structures (e.g., nerves, vessels).

## Operations Done with MIS

   - `Fundoplication` (for GERD)
   - `Bariatric surgery` (Gastric bypass, Sleeve gastrectomy)
1. **Gynecologic Surgery**
   - `Laparoscopic hysterectomy`
   - `Ovarian cystectomy`
   - `Endometriosis excision`
1. **Urologic Surgery**
   - `Laparoscopic nephrectomy`
   - `Prostatectomy` (Robotic-assisted for prostate cancer)
   - `Ureteroscopy for kidney stones`
1. **Orthopedic Surgery**
   - `Arthroscopic knee/shoulder surgery`
   - `Minimally invasive spine surgery`
1. **Cardiothoracic Surgery**
   - `Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)`
   - `Robot-assisted mitral valve repair`
   - `Endoscopic coronary artery bypass`
1. **Neurosurgery**
   - `Endoscopic pituitary tumor removal`
   - `Minimally invasive spinal decompression`
1. **Vascular Surgery**
   - `Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)`
   - `Angioplasty and stenting`

## Advantages

### 1. Reduced Surgical Trauma

- **Smaller incisions** → Less tissue damage.
- **Less postoperative pain** → Less need for opioids.

### 2. Faster Recovery & Shorter Hospital Stay

- Less wound healing time.
- **Earlier mobilization** → Reduces risk of **DVT & pneumonia**.

### 3. Lower Risk of Infections & Wound Complications

- **Smaller wounds** reduce risk of **surgical site infection (SSI)**.
- Lower incidence of **incisional hernia**.

### 4. Better Cosmetic Outcome

- **Minimal scarring** due to smaller incisions.

### 5. Less Blood Loss

- Reduced risk of **anemia** and need for **transfusion**.

### 6. Improved Visualization & Precision

- **Magnified view** allows precise dissection and reduces errors.
- Robotic-assited surgery enhances precision

## Limitations

### 1. Steep Learning Curve & High Skill Requirement

- Requires **specialized training & experience**.
- Increased risk of **complications if performed by inexperienced surgeons**.

### 2. Longer Operative Time

- **Initial setup (port placement, insufflation) takes time**.
- **Increased difficulty in complex procedures**.

### 3. High Equipment Cost & Maintenance

- **Expensive instruments** (laparoscopic towers, robotic systems).
- **Limited availability in resource-poor settings**.

### 4. Reduced Tactile Feedback

- **Surgeons rely on visual cues instead of direct touch**.
- Can lead to **missed injuries (e.g., bowel perforation)**.

### 5. Anesthesia Risks

- Requires **prolonged general anesthesia**.
- **Pneumoperitoneum (CO₂ insufflation) risks**:
  - ↓ Venous return → Hypotension.
  - CO₂ absorption → Respiratory acidosis.

## Contraindications

### 1. Absolute Contraindications

1. **Hemodynamically Unstable Patients**
   - **Severe hemorrhage** → Open surgery preferred for rapid control.
1. **Severe Adhesions (Dense Intra-abdominal or Post-Surgical Adhesions)**
   - **High risk of injury to organs (e.g., bowel, bladder)**.
1. **Uncontrolled Coagulopathy**
   - ↑ Bleeding risk → Poor visualization & control.
1. **Massive Abdominal Distension (e.g., Bowel Perforation with Peritonitis)**
   - Pneumoperitoneum worsens condition → Open surgery needed.
1. **Advanced Malignancy with Infiltration**
   - **Locally invasive tumors** require open resection.

### 2. Relative Contraindications (MIS May Be Difficult or Risky)

1. **Extensive Obesity (BMI >40 kg/m²)**
   - Limited access & visualization.
1. **Pregnancy (Late Stages)**
   - **Risk to fetus** (CO₂ insufflation effects).
1. **Large Abdominal Masses (e.g., Huge Ovarian Tumor, Large Hernia)**
   - Poor maneuverability in limited space.
1. **Severe Cardiopulmonary Disease**
   - **Pneumoperitoneum increases intra-abdominal pressure**, reducing venous return → worsens cardiac function.
1. **Severe COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)**
   - **CO₂ insufflation causes hypercarbia & acidosis**.
