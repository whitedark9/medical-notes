# Hernia

> Protrusion of a viscus or part of a viscus through an abnormal opening in the wall of its containing cavity (usually abdominal wall).

<details>
<summary>Types of hernia</summary>

### I. According to Location

1. **Inguinal hernia**: Most common; occurs in the groin.
2. **Femoral hernia**: Below inguinal ligament; more common in females.
3. **Umbilical hernia**: At the umbilicus (congenital or acquired).
4. **Epigastric hernia**: Through the linea alba above umbilicus.
5. **Incisional hernia**: At the site of previous surgical incision.
6. **Spigelian hernia**: Through the Spigelian fascia (lateral to rectus muscle).
7. **Obturator hernia**: Through obturator foramen; rare and often in elderly women.
8. **Lumbar hernia**: Through lumbar triangle (Petit's or Grynfeltt's triangle).
9. **Perineal hernia**: Through pelvic floor.
10. **Internal hernia**: Protrusion within the peritoneal cavity (e.g., paraduodenal).

### II. According to Reducibility

1. **Reducible hernia**: Contents return to the cavity manually or spontaneously.
2. **Irreducible (incarcerated) hernia**: Contents cannot be reduced.
3. **Obstructed hernia**: Irreducible and bowel lumen is obstructed.
4. **Strangulated hernia**: Blood supply to the contents is compromised → ischemia.

## Inguinal Hernia

> Herniation of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal or adjacent regions in the groin.

### Anatomical Types

1. **Indirect inguinal hernia**
   - **Pathway**: Through deep inguinal ring → inguinal canal → superficial ring.
   - **Lateral** to inferior epigastric vessels.
   - Often **congenital** (persistent processus vaginalis).
2. **Direct inguinal hernia**
   - **Pathway**: Directly through posterior wall of inguinal canal (Hesselbach's triangle).
   - **Medial** to inferior epigastric vessels.
   - Usually **acquired** due to weakness in abdominal wall.

## Management of Irreducible Inguinal Hernia

> Hernia that cannot be manually reduced into the abdominal cavity, but **without** signs of bowel obstruction or vascular compromise.

### Emergency Management

1. **A – Airway**: Ensure airway is patent. Usually not compromised.
2. **B – Breathing**: Check for respiratory distress due to pain or sepsis.
3. **C – Circulation**:
   - Monitor vitals (BP, HR).
   - IV access for fluids, analgesics.
4. **D – Disability**: Assess mental status (rule out sepsis or metabolic cause).
5. **E – Exposure**: Inspect and palpate the hernia site for:
   - Tenderness, skin changes
   - Size and irreducibility
6. **F – Fluid**:
   - Start IV fluids if patient is dehydrated or obstructed.
   - NPO (nil per os) if surgery likely.

### Definitive Management

#### 1. Initial Attempt at Reduction (if no signs of strangulation)

- **Gentle manual reduction (taxis)**:
  - Done with analgesia and sedation.
  - Elevate hips, cold compress.
- **Contraindicated** if:
  - Pain is severe
  - Strangulation suspected
  - Signs of obstruction

#### 2. Surgical Management

Surgery is required if:

- Reduction fails
- Strangulation or obstruction suspected
- High risk of recurrence or complications

##### Surgical Options

1. **Elective surgery** (if successfully reduced):
   - `Open mesh repair` (Lichtenstein)
   - `Laparoscopic repair` (TEP/TAPP)
1. **Emergency surgery** (if irreducible or failed taxis):
   - **Explore hernia sac**: Check bowel viability.
   - **Viable bowel**: `Hernioplasty` ± `herniotomy`.
   - **Non-viable bowel**: Resect necrotic segment → anastomosis + hernia repair.
   - Mesh is **avoided** if contamination present (e.g., strangulated bowel).
   - **Peritoneal washout** if peritonitis present.
   - **Post-op ICU care** if sepsis or bowel resection.

## Complications

- Wound infection
- Recurrence
- Bowel resection complications: leak, ileus
- Testicular atrophy (if cord compromised)

## Types of Inguinal Hernia Surgery

> Inguinal hernia surgery involves **hernia sac management** ± **posterior wall reinforcement**.

Choice depends on age, type of hernia, recurrence, contamination, and surgeon expertise.

### I. Open Hernia Repairs

#### 1. Herniotomy

> Excision of hernia sac only.

- **Indication**: **Children** (e.g., congenital indirect hernia)
- **Key Point**: No need for posterior wall repair (no weakness)

#### 2. Herniorrhaphy

> Sac removal + repair of posterior wall using **non-mesh (tissue repair)**.

- **Indications**:
  - Small hernia
  - **Contaminated field** (e.g., strangulated bowel)
- **Types**:
  - `Bassini Repair`: Approximate conjoint tendon to inguinal ligament
  - `Shouldice Repair`: Layered tissue repair; lower recurrence than Bassini

#### 3. Hernioplasty

> Sac removal + **mesh reinforcement** of posterior wall.

- **Standard for adults**
- **Types**:
  - `Lichtenstein repair`:
    - Most commonly used
    - Flat mesh over posterior wall
    - Simple, low recurrence
  - `Plug and Patch repair`:
    - Mesh plug inserted into deep ring + flat mesh over posterior wall

### II. Laparoscopic Hernia Repairs

- Minimally invasive; uses mesh placed in preperitoneal space
- **Advantage**: Less pain, quicker recovery, bilateral repair possible

#### 1. TEP – Totally Extraperitoneal Repair

- Mesh placed **without entering peritoneal cavity**
- Lower risk of visceral injury
- Technically demanding

#### 2. TAPP – Transabdominal Preperitoneal Repair

- Enter peritoneal cavity → dissect preperitoneal space → place mesh
- Easier to perform than TEP
- Slightly higher risk of intra-abdominal injury

### III. Emergency Hernia Surgery (Strangulated/Incarcerated)

- **Sac opened** → assess contents
- **Viable bowel**: Reduce + tissue repair or mesh (if clean field)
- **Non-viable bowel**:
  - Resection + anastomosis
  - Avoid mesh (risk of infection) → tissue repair (e.g., Bassini)
