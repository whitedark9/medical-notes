# Incisional Hernia

> An _incisional hernia_ is a type of **ventral abdominal hernia** that occurs through a **previous surgical incision site** in the abdominal wall due to failure of fascial tissue healing.

## Aetiology (Causes)

- **Failure of fascial healing** post-laparotomy
- **Excessive tension** on wound closure
- **Infection** at surgical site → impairs healing
- **Inadequate surgical technique**
- **Poor quality of sutures/materials**
- **Obesity** → increased intra-abdominal pressure on wound
- **Emergency surgery** → often uses midline incisions under urgent conditions
- **Repeat surgeries** through same incision

## Predisposing Factors

(Contributors to weakened healing or increased intra-abdominal pressure)

### A. Patient-related

- **Obesity**
- **Advanced age**
- **Poor nutritional status** (e.g. hypoalbuminemia)
- **Chronic illnesses** (e.g. diabetes mellitus, renal failure)
- **Smoking**
- **Immunosuppression** (e.g. steroids, chemotherapy)

### B. Surgery-related

- **Wound infection**
- **Poor surgical technique** (e.g. not including rectus sheath)
- **Use of absorbable sutures in fascial closure**
- **Large midline incisions**
- **Prolonged post-op ileus** → increased intra-abdominal pressure

## Complications

### A. Early complications

1. **Pain and discomfort**
2. **Seroma or haematoma formation**
3. **Wound dehiscence** → fascial layers separate post-op

### B. Late complications

1. **Incarceration**
   - hernia contents get trapped
   - cannot be reduced back into the abdomen
2. **Obstruction**
   - bowel becomes obstructed within the hernia sac
   - colicky pain, vomiting, distension
3. **Strangulation**
   - vascular compromise of herniated bowel
   - leads to ischaemia and necrosis
   - surgical emergency
4. **Ulceration of overlying skin**
   - due to pressure or repeated friction
5. **Recurrence**
   - even after repair, especially without mesh or in high-risk patients

## Investigation

### A. History

- Onset, duration, progression of swelling
- Relation to previous surgery
- Reducibility of hernia
- Symptoms of obstruction or strangulation:
  → abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, non-reducible swelling

### B. Physical Examination

- Location of swelling along previous scar
- Cough impulse
- Reducibility
- Skin changes: erythema, ulceration
- Signs of obstruction or strangulation

### C. Imaging

1. **Ultrasound abdomen**
   - Initial evaluation
   - Can confirm defect and contents
2. **CT scan abdomen (preferred)**
   - Defines size of defect, contents
   - Identifies incarceration, strangulation
   - Helps plan surgical repair

## Management

### Indications for Surgery

- Symptomatic hernia
- Large hernia
- Incarcerated or strangulated hernia
- Cosmetic reasons (optional)

### Types of Surgery

#### 1. Open Repair

- _Primary suture repair_:
  → Suitable for small defects (< 2 cm)
  → High recurrence
- _Mesh repair (Lichtenstein technique)_:
  → Standard approach
  → Mesh placed in onlay, inlay, sublay, or underlay position
  → Reduces recurrence
- **Component separation** for very large defects

#### 2. Laparoscopic Repair

- Indicated for:
  → Medium-sized defects
  → Obese patients
  → Multiple previous surgeries
- Mesh placed intra-peritoneally with fixation
- **Advantages**:
  → Less pain
  → Shorter hospital stay
  → Lower wound infection rate
  → But: higher cost, requires expertise

### Pre-operative Preparation

- Control of comorbidities: DM, COPD
- Smoking cessation
- Nutritional support if malnourished
- Weight reduction if obese
- Bowel prep if needed

### Post-operative Complications

- Wound infection
- Seroma/haematoma
- Recurrence
- Mesh infection → may require mesh removal
- Chronic pain

### Management of Complications

- **Infection** → antibiotics ± drainage
- **Seroma** → observation or aspiration
- **Recurrence** → repeat mesh repair
- **Strangulation (emergency)** → bowel resection + hernia repair
