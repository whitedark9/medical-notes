# Breast Cancer

## Staging

<details>
<summary>Breast cancer staging is based on the TNM system (Tumor, Node, Metastasis), developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).</summary>

### Step 1: Determine T (Tumor Size & Extent)

| T Stage | Description                                                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tis** | Carcinoma in situ (DCIS, LCIS, Paget's disease without tumor)             |
| **T1**  | Tumor ≤ 20 mm (subdivided as: T1a ≤ 5 mm, T1b = 5-10 mm, T1c = 10-20 mm)  |
| **T2**  | Tumor > 20 mm but ≤ 50 mm                                                 |
| **T3**  | Tumor > 50 mm                                                             |
| **T4**  | Tumor extends to chest wall or skin (includes inflammatory breast cancer) |

### Step 2: Determine N (Lymph Node Involvement)

| N Stage | Description                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **N0**  | No regional lymph node involvement                                                           |
| **N1**  | Metastasis in 1-3 axillary lymph nodes                                                       |
| **N2**  | Metastasis in 4-9 axillary lymph nodes                                                       |
| **N3**  | Metastasis in ≥10 axillary nodes or involvement of internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes |

### Step 3: Determine M (Distant Metastasis)

| M Stage | Description                                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M0**  | No distant metastasis                                       |
| **M1**  | Distant metastasis present (e.g., bone, liver, lung, brain) |

### Assign the Clinical Stage (0 - IV) Based on TNM

| Stage    | T (Tumor) | N (Nodes) | M (Metastasis) |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | -------------- |
| **0**    | Tis       | N0        | M0             |
| **I**    | T1        | N0        | M0             |
| **IIA**  | T0-T1     | N1        | M0             |
| **IIA**  | T2        | N0        | M0             |
| **IIB**  | T2        | N1        | M0             |
| **IIB**  | T3        | N0        | M0             |
| **IIIA** | T0-T3     | N2        | M0             |
| **IIIA** | T3        | N1        | M0             |
| **IIIB** | T4        | Any N     | M0             |
| **IIIC** | Any T     | N3        | M0             |
| **IV**   | Any T     | Any N     | M1             |

</details>

## Early Breast Cancer

> Breast cancer that is localized and has not spread beyond the breast or nearby lymph nodes.

1. **Stage 0**: `Tis N0 M0` (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ - DCIS)
1. **Stage I**: `T1 N0 M0` (Small tumor, no nodes involved)
1. **Stage II (some cases)**: `T0-T2 N0-N1 M0` (Limited lymph node involvement)

Prognosis: High cure rate with surgery + adjuvant therapy.

## Advanced Breast Cancer

> Breast cancer that has spread extensively either locally or to distant sites.

1. **Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC)**: `T3-T4` or `N2-N3 M0`
1. **Metastatic breast cancer (MBC)**: `Any T, Any N, M1` (Distant spread to liver, bone, lungs, brain)

Prognosis: Incurable in metastatic cases, but treatment can prolong survival and improve quality of life.

## Triple Assessment

### 1. Clinical Examination

#### History

- **Symptoms**:
  - Breast lump (painless, hard, irregular)
  - Nipple discharge (bloody, serous, or purulent)
  - Skin changes (peau d'orange, ulceration, erythema)
  - Nipple inversion or retraction
  - Breast pain (usually late or in inflammatory cancer)
  - Axillary swelling (lymphadenopathy)
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Family history of breast cancer (BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations)
  - Early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity
  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), oral contraceptives
  - Prior history of radiation to the chest
  - Obesity, alcohol consumption

#### Physical Examination

- **Inspection** (compare both breasts):
  - Skin changes (redness, thickening, ulceration)
  - Nipple abnormalities (inversion, deviation, discharge)
  - Visible lumps or retraction
  - Peau de orange (orange peel appearance due to lymphatic blockage)
- **Palpation**:
  - **Lump characteristics**:
    - Hard, irregular, fixed → suggests malignancy
    - Mobile, well-defined, soft → suggests benign (e.g., fibroadenoma)
  - **Nipple discharge assessment**:
    - Single duct, bloody → suspicious for malignancy
    - Multiple ducts, milky → hormonal or benign
  - **Axillary, supraclavicular, or infraclavicular lymph nodes**:
    - Hard, fixed, matted nodes → suggest malignancy
  - **Bimanual palpation & comparison with contralateral breast**

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

#### 3.1 Fine-Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)

- **Indications**:
  - Easily palpable lumps
  - Evaluating axillary lymph nodes
- **Advantages**:
  - Quick, minimally invasive
  - High sensitivity for detecting malignancy
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot differentiate in situ vs. invasive carcinoma
  - May yield insufficient material

#### 3.2 Core Needle Biopsy (CNB)

- **Gold standard for histological diagnosis**
- **Indications**:
  - Any BI-RADS 4 or 5 lesion
  - FNAC inconclusive or discordant with imaging
  - Differentiating invasive vs. in situ carcinoma
- **Advantages**:
  - Preserves tissue architecture for receptor testing (ER, PR, HER2)
- **Limitations**:
  - More invasive than FNAC
  - Risk of bleeding or infection

#### 3.3 Excisional Biopsy

- **Indications**:
  - FNAC/core biopsy inconclusive
  - Suspicious lesion < 1 cm (complete removal preferred)
  - Recurrent breast lesion with previous negative biopsy
- **Types**:
  - **Wire-guided excision**: If lesion is non-palpable
  - **Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)**: For early breast cancer staging

#### 3.4 Histopathological Analysis

- **Grading (Nottingham system)**:
  - **Grade 1 (Well-differentiated)** → Slow-growing
  - **Grade 2 (Moderately differentiated)**
  - **Grade 3 (Poorly differentiated)** → Aggressive tumor
- **Receptor Status Testing**:
  - **Estrogen receptor (ER) & Progesterone receptor (PR)** → Guides hormone therapy
  - **HER2/neu status** → Determines need for targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab)
  - **Ki-67 index** → Measures proliferation rate

## Management of Early Breast Cancer (EBC)

> Curative treatment with surgery ± Adjuvant therapy

### Surgical Management

#### 1. Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS)

> Lumpectomy + Radiation Therapy

- **Indications**:
  - Tumor < 5 cm (T1-T2)
  - Single lesion or multifocal lesions in the same quadrant
  - No contraindication to radiation therapy
- **Procedure**:
  - Wide local excision (removal of tumor with negative margins)
  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) ± axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)
  - Postoperative whole-breast radiation therapy to prevent recurrence
- **Contraindications**:
  - Multifocal or multicentric tumors in different quadrants
  - Large tumor-to-breast ratio
  - Prior radiation to the breast
  - Pregnancy (if radiation is needed)

#### 2. Mastectomy (Total Removal of Breast Tissue)

- **Types**:
  1. **Simple (Total) Mastectomy** → Removes the entire breast but spares axillary nodes.
  2. **Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM)** → Removes the entire breast + axillary lymph nodes.
  3. **Skin-Sparing Mastectomy (SSM)** → Preserves the skin envelope for immediate reconstruction.
  4. **Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy (NSM)** → Preserves skin + nipple-areolar complex (select cases).
- **Indications**:
  - Large tumor (>5 cm) or diffuse microcalcifications
  - Multicentric or recurrent tumors
  - Patient preference for mastectomy over BCS
  - Contraindications to radiation therapy
- **Axillary Surgery with Mastectomy**:
  - **Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB)** → If clinically node-negative
  - **Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND)** → If node-positive or large tumors
- **Reconstruction Options** (Done immediately or delayed):
  - Autologous tissue reconstruction (e.g., TRAM flap, DIEP flap)
  - Implant-based reconstruction

### Adjuvant Therapy (Post-Surgical)

- **Radiation Therapy (RT)**:
  - Given after BCS or in high-risk mastectomy cases (T3, node-positive).
- **Hormonal Therapy** (for ER+/PR+ tumors):
  - Tamoxifen (pre-menopausal) or Aromatase Inhibitors (post-menopausal).
- **Chemotherapy**:
  - Indicated in **high-risk patients** (e.g., node-positive, HER2+).
- **Targeted Therapy**:
  - Trastuzumab for HER2+ tumors.

## Management of Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC)

> Improve survival and palliate symptoms (in MBC)

### 1. Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (LABC) (T3-T4, N2-N3, M0)

- **Primary Treatment**:

  - **Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)** → Shrinks tumor before surgery.
  - **Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM)** → Standard surgery after NAC.
  - **Postoperative Radiation Therapy** → To control local recurrence.
  - **Adjuvant Hormonal & Targeted Therapy** (as per receptor status).

- **Surgical Details in LABC**:
  - **Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) is preferred** over BCS.
  - **Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) is mandatory** if nodes are clinically positive.
  - If **NAC response is good**, some cases may become eligible for BCS.

### 2. Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) (Stage IV, Any T, Any N, M1)

> Palliative treatment, NOT curative

- **Systemic Therapy** is the mainstay:

  - Hormonal therapy (if ER+/PR+)
  - Chemotherapy (if triple-negative or aggressive disease)
  - Targeted therapy (HER2+ → Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab)

- **Surgical Role in MBC**:

  - **Palliative Mastectomy** → Only for ulcerated, bleeding, or infected tumors.
  - **Palliative ALND** → If axillary disease is painful or causing lymphedema.

- **Radiotherapy & Bone-directed Therapy**:
  - Used for **brain metastases, painful bone metastases, or spinal cord compression**.
  - **Bisphosphonates or Denosumab** given for bone metastases.
