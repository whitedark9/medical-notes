# Pseudocyst of Pancreas

> A **pancreatic pseudocyst** is a collection of pancreatic fluid enclosed by a wall of **non-epithelialised, fibrous or granulation tissue**, usually occurring **after acute or chronic pancreatitis**.

## Etiology

- **Acute pancreatitis** (especially alcohol-induced)
- **Chronic pancreatitis** (alcoholic, idiopathic)
- **Pancreatic trauma** (especially blunt abdominal trauma in children)
- **Pancreatic duct obstruction** (stones, tumours)

## Pathophysiology

- Inflammation or ductal disruption → leakage of pancreatic enzymes →
  → Fluid collection in/around pancreas
  → Enzymes digest surrounding tissue → localized necrosis
  → Body walls off fluid with granulation and fibrous tissue (not true epithelium)
  → **Pseudocyst** forms (usually >4 weeks after insult)

## Clinical Features

- Often presents **2–6 weeks after pancreatitis or trauma**
- **Epigastric mass** (palpable)
- **Persistent abdominal pain**
- **Early satiety, nausea, vomiting** (gastric compression)
- **Jaundice** (bile duct compression)
- History of recent **pancreatitis** or **trauma**

## Diagnosis

### A. History

- Recent pancreatitis (acute/chronic)
- Alcohol use
- Abdominal trauma (especially in children)
- Symptoms of mass effect (pain, early satiety, vomiting)

### B. Physical Examination

- **Epigastric tenderness**
- **Palpable, smooth, tender mass** (in \~30–50%)
- Look for signs of chronic pancreatitis (steatorrhoea, weight loss)

### C. Investigations

#### Laboratory

- Serum **amylase/lipase**: may be elevated
- **LFTs**: assess biliary involvement
- **CEA & CA19-9**: to rule out cystic neoplasms if diagnosis unclear
- **Aspiration (if needed)**
  - High amylase = pseudocyst
  - Low amylase + high CEA = cystic neoplasm

#### Imaging

- **Ultrasound**
  - First-line
  - Anechoic or hypoechoic cystic structure near pancreas
- **Contrast-enhanced CT scan**
  - Investigation of choice
  - Shows size, location, wall thickness
  - Distinguishes pseudocyst from necrosis or cystic neoplasm
- **MRI/MRCP**
  - Better ductal anatomy
  - Assess communication with pancreatic duct

## Management

### A. Emergency (if rupture, infection, bleeding)

1. **A – Airway**: Ensure airway in case of shock or altered mental status
2. **B – Breathing**: Support ventilation
3. **C – Circulation**: IV fluids, correct shock, crossmatch if bleeding
4. **D – Disability**: Assess consciousness (especially with sepsis or hemorrhage)
5. **E – Exposure**: Examine for peritonism or bruising (Grey-Turner/Cullen sign)
6. **F – Fluids**: Aggressive IV fluids and electrolyte correction

### B. Definitive Treatment

#### Conservative (Observation)

- Indications:
  - Asymptomatic
  - < 6 cm
  - < 6 weeks duration
- Monitor with serial imaging
- Spontaneous resolution possible

#### Drainage (if symptomatic or complications)

**Indications**:

- Persistent pain
- Infection
- Hemorrhage
- Obstruction (biliary or gastric)
- Increasing size
- Cyst >6 cm and >6 weeks old

**Drainage methods**:

- **Endoscopic drainage (preferred if feasible)**
  - Transgastric or transduodenal
  - Cyst must be adherent to gut wall
- **Percutaneous drainage**
  - Guided by US/CT
  - Risk: external pancreatic fistula
- **Surgical drainage** (if endoscopic fails or not possible)
  - **Cystogastrostomy** (most common)
  - **Cystojejunostomy**, **cystoduodenostomy** (depending on location)

## Complications

- Infection → abscess formation
- Rupture → peritonitis
- Hemorrhage (into cyst or surrounding vessels)
- Obstruction → biliary, gastric outlet
- Fistula formation
- Misdiagnosis → cystic neoplasm mistaken as pseudocyst
