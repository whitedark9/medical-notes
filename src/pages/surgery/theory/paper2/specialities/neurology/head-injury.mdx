# Head Injury

> Head injury refers to any trauma to the **scalp, skull, or brain** that may result in temporary or permanent neurological dysfunction, including **concussion, skull fractures, and intracranial haemorrhage** (e.g. extradural, subdural, intracerebral).

## Causes of Head Injury

1. **Trauma (most common)**
   - Road traffic accidents (RTAs)
   - Falls (especially in elderly/children)
   - Assault
   - Sports injuries
   - Industrial or occupational accidents
2. **Penetrating Injuries**
   - Gunshot wounds
   - Stab wounds
   - Shrapnel/blast injuries
3. **Secondary Causes**
   - Alcohol or drug intoxication → fall/accident
   - Seizures → fall with head trauma
   - Anticoagulation → risk of intracranial bleed after mild trauma

## Clinical Features of Head Injury

### A. Symptoms

1. Loss of consciousness (brief or prolonged)
2. Amnesia
   - Retrograde (before trauma)
   - Anterograde (after trauma)
3. Headache
4. Nausea/Vomiting
5. Confusion or altered behaviour
6. Seizures
7. CSF rhinorrhoea/otorrhoea[^1] → base of skull fracture

### B. Signs

1. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) evaluation
   - Mild: 13–15
   - Moderate: 9–12
   - Severe: ≤8
2. Pupil changes (unequal, dilated)
3. Post-traumatic amnesia
4. Focal neurological signs (e.g. hemiparesis, aphasia)
5. Signs of raised ICP (Cushing's triad[^2]: bradycardia, hypertension, irregular respirations)
6. Signs of skull fracture
   - Battle’s sign (mastoid bruising)
   - Raccoon eyes (periorbital ecchymosis)
   - CSF leak

## Investigation

### a. Imaging

- **CT Brain** (non-contrast): gold standard for acute evaluation
  - Skull fracture
  - Intracranial haemorrhage (EDH, SDH, SAH, ICH)
  - Midline shift, cerebral oedema
- **X-ray**: not routine; may help in penetrating trauma

### b. Laboratory

- FBC, coagulation profile (esp. on anticoagulants)
- Blood glucose, U\&E
- Blood alcohol and toxicology screen (if intoxicated)

## Management of Head Injury

### A. Emergency Management

- A – Airway
  - Maintain airway; intubate if GCS ≤8
- B – Breathing
  - Assess and support ventilation (may need mechanical ventilation)
- C – Circulation
  - Control haemorrhage
  - IV access and fluid resuscitation (avoid hypotension)
  - Maintain cerebral perfusion pressure
- D – Disability
  - Assess GCS, pupil size/reactivity
  - Check for spinal cord injury
  - Consider mannitol if signs of raised ICP
- E – Exposure
  - Full-body examination
- Avoid hypothermia
- F – Fluids
  - Avoid hypotonic fluids (may worsen cerebral oedema)

### B. Definitive Management

#### a. Non-Surgical Management

- For mild head injury (GCS 13–15, no CT abnormalities)
  - Observation (4–24 hrs depending on risk)
  - Avoid sedatives
  - Monitor for deterioration

#### b. Surgical Management

**Indications:**

- Extradural/Subdural haematoma > thickness or causing midline shift
- Deteriorating GCS
- Open or depressed skull fractures
- Penetrating injuries
- CSF leaks not resolving conservatively

**Procedures:**

1. **Craniotomy** for evacuation of haematoma
1. **Decompressive craniectomy** in diffuse brain swelling
1. **Repair of dural tears or skull base defects** (in persistent CSF leak)
1. **Wound debridement** for open fractures or penetrating trauma

### C. Postoperative / Long-term Care

- ICU monitoring
- Seizure prophylaxis (e.g. phenytoin)
- Neurorehabilitation
- Monitor for complications (e.g. hydrocephalus, infection)

## Complications

1. **Early**
   - Raised intracranial pressure
   - Brain herniation
   - Seizures
   - CSF leak and meningitis
2. **Late**
   - Post-traumatic epilepsy
   - Neurocognitive deficits
   - Chronic subdural haematoma
   - Hydrocephalus

[^1]: **CSF rhinorrhoea/otorrhoea**: leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from nose/ear, typically due to base of skull fracture.

[^2]: **Cushing's triad**: physiological response to raised ICP — bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations.
