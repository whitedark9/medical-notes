# Cystic Hygroma (Lymphangioma)

> Cystic hygroma is a benign congenital lymphatic malformation consisting of multiloculated, fluid-filled cystic spaces, typically occurring in the neck or axilla, resulting from abnormal development of lymphatic channels.

## Etiology

- Congenital anomaly of lymphatic system
- Failure of lymphatic sacs to connect with venous drainage
- Associated syndromes:
  - Turner syndrome (45,X)
  - Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)
  - Noonan syndrome
  - Trisomy 13, 18

<details>
<summary>Pathophysiology</summary>

- Embryologic lymphatic sequestration → isolated lymph sacs
- Non-communicating with systemic lymphatics → fluid accumulation
- Expands into adjacent soft tissues
- Common sites:
  - **Neck** (posterior triangle, >75%)
  - Axilla
  - Mediastinum, retroperitoneum, groin (less common)

</details>

## Clinical Features

- **At birth or within first 2 years**
- **Soft, painless, fluctuant swelling**
- Transilluminant
- May rapidly enlarge during URTI or trauma
- Large lesions → airway obstruction, feeding difficulties
- If infected: redness, tenderness, systemic signs

## Investigations

### Imaging

- **Ultrasound**:
  - First-line
  - Multiloculated cystic mass with clear fluid
- **MRI** (preferred over CT):
  - Determines deep extension
  - Useful in surgical planning
- **CT scan**:
  - If MRI unavailable
  - Avoid in infants unless necessary
- **Fetal ultrasound**:
  - Can detect large hygromas by 18–20 weeks
  - Often associated with hydrops fetalis or chromosomal abnormalities

### Additional

- **Karyotyping** if antenatal diagnosis or syndromic features present
- Chest imaging if lesion extends into mediastinum

## Management

### Emergency (if airway compromised)

1. **A – Airway**: Secure (intubation or tracheostomy if needed)
2. **B – Breathing**: Support ventilation, oxygen supplementation
3. **C – Circulation**: IV fluids if hypotensive or infected
4. **D – Disability**: Assess neurological status
5. **E – Exposure**: Examine entire body for other malformations
6. **F – Fluids**: Maintain hydration, especially pre-op

### Definitive Treatment

#### 1. Surgical Excision

- **Indications**:
  - Cosmetic reasons
  - Recurrent infections
  - Airway or esophageal compression
  - Failure of sclerotherapy
- **Pre-op preparation**:
  - MRI for anatomical mapping
  - Anaesthetic assessment (possible difficult airway)
  - Inform risk of incomplete excision
- **Procedure**:
  - Aim: complete excision
  - Often technically challenging due to infiltration around vital structures (e.g., carotid sheath, cranial nerves)
  - Incomplete excision → high recurrence
- **Post-op complications**:
  - Recurrence
  - Infection or seroma
  - Nerve injury (facial, accessory, hypoglossal)
  - Scar and cosmetic deformity

#### 2. Sclerotherapy

- **Agents**: OK-432 (`Picibanil`), `bleomycin`, `doxycycline`
- **Indications**:
  - Lesions not amenable to surgery
  - Medically unfit patients
  - Deep/infiltrative lesions
- **Procedure**:
  - US-guided aspiration + sclerosant injection
  - May need multiple sessions
- **Complications**:
  - Local inflammation
  - Fever
  - Rare: airway oedema, nerve injury

## Complications

- Infection
- Haemorrhage into cyst
- Airway compromise
- Recurrence
- Cosmetic deformity
- Associated syndromes → long-term developmental issues
