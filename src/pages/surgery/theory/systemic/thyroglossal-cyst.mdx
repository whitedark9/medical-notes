# Thyroglossal Cyst

> A thyroglossal cyst is a **congenital midline neck mass** resulting from persistent epithelial remnants of the thyroglossal duct — the embryological tract of the thyroid gland descent from the foramen cecum to the neck.

## Embryology & Etiology

- Thyroid gland originates at the **foramen cecum** (base of the tongue)
- Descends to its final position via the **thyroglossal duct**
- Normally obliterated by the 10th week of gestation
- Failure of involution → cystic dilation of duct → thyroglossal cyst

## Pathophysiology

- Persistent thyroglossal duct epithelium → mucous secretions accumulate → cyst formation
- May get infected → painful, enlarging midline mass
- 70% contain ectopic thyroid tissue
- May be the **only functional thyroid tissue** in some individuals

## Clinical Features

- **Midline neck swelling**, usually just below the hyoid bone
- Moves **upward with swallowing and tongue protrusion**
- Usually painless unless infected
- May present after **upper respiratory infection**
- Infected cyst: red, tender, fluctuant mass with possible discharging sinus
- Can occur at any age but usually diagnosed in **childhood or early adulthood**

### History

- Gradually enlarging, painless midline neck lump
- May have prior episodes of swelling/infection
- Ask about **dysphagia**, **dyspnoea**, or **rapid enlargement**

### Physical Examination

- Midline neck mass (infrahyoid most common)
- Moves with **swallowing** and **tongue protrusion**
- Not pulsatile, not transilluminant
- May have sinus or fistula if ruptured or recurrently infected

## Investigations

### Imaging

- **Ultrasound neck**
  - First-line
  - Confirms cystic nature
  - Locates normal thyroid gland (to ensure presence before excision)
- **Thyroid scan** (Technetium-99m)
  - Done if ultrasound inconclusive
  - Ensures orthotopic thyroid present before surgery
- **MRI/CT** (rarely needed)
  - For recurrent or atypical cysts

### Laboratory

- TSH and T3/T4 if abnormal thyroid function suspected

## Management

### Emergency (if infected cyst causing airway issues)

1. **A – Airway**: Secure if obstructed (rare)
2. **B – Breathing**: Support if respiratory distress
3. **C – Circulation**: IV fluids and antibiotics if febrile or septic
4. **D – Disability**: Assess sensorium if septic
5. **E – Exposure**: Look for fistula or multiple cysts
6. **F – Fluids**: Maintain hydration

### Definitive Treatment

#### Sistrunk Operation (Standard of Care)

- **Excision of cyst**, **middle portion of the hyoid bone**, and **tract up to the foramen cecum**
- Removes all remnants to reduce recurrence
- **Indications**:
  - Symptomatic cyst
  - Infection
  - Cosmetic concern
  - Fistula formation

##### Why middle hyoid bone is excised:

→ Tract typically loops around or passes through the hyoid → risk of recurrence if not removed

#### Treatment of Infected Cyst

- Initial infection:
  - Antibiotics
  - Incision & drainage if abscess
- Delay Sistrunk procedure until infection resolves

## Complications

- Infection
- Fistula or sinus tract formation
- Recurrence (↑ if incomplete excision)
- Haematoma, seroma
- Scar/keloid
- Rare: **thyroglossal duct carcinoma** (usually papillary)
