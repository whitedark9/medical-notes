# Causes of Surgical Jaundice

> Jaundice caused by **extrahepatic biliary obstruction** that often requires **surgical or interventional treatment**.

## Classification Based on Site

### A. Intraluminal Causes (within the bile duct lumen)

1. **Gallstones** (choledocholithiasis) - most common cause
1. **Parasites** (e.g., _Clonorchis sinensis_, _Ascaris lumbricoides_)

### B. Mural Causes (wall of the bile duct)

1. **Cholangiocarcinoma** (bile duct cancer)
1. **Benign strictures**
   - Post-cholecystectomy
   - Chronic pancreatitis
1. **Sclerosing cholangitis**

### C. Extramural Causes (outside compression of bile duct)

1. **Carcinoma head of pancreas**
1. **Periampullary carcinoma**
1. **Pancreatic pseudocyst**
1. **Lymphadenopathy** at porta hepatis (e.g., from lymphoma or TB)
1. **Mirizzi syndrome** - impacted stone in cystic duct compressing common hepatic duct

## 2. Classification by Onset

### A. Sudden-Onset Obstruction

- Gallstone obstruction
- Blood clot in biliary tract (e.g., post-ERCP)

### B. Gradual-Onset Obstruction

- Malignancy (pancreatic or biliary)
- Benign strictures
- Sclerosing cholangitis

## Casues

> GAMP CLIPS

- `G`allstones
- `A`scariasis
- `M`alignancy (pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder)
- `P`ancreatitis (chronic or pseudocyst)
- `C`holangiocarcinoma
- `L`ymphadenopathy
- `I`atrogenic strictures (post-surgical)
- `P`rimary sclerosing cholangitis
- `S`trictures (benign or malignant)

## Notes on Common Causes:

### [Gallstones (Choledocholithiasis)](/surgery/theory/systemic/gallstones)

- Obstruct common bile duct
- Associated with RUQ pain, cholangitis

### [Carcinoma of Head of Pancreas](/surgery/theory/systemic/ca-head-of-pancreas)

- Painless progressive jaundice
- **Courvoisier's law**: palpable gallbladder + jaundice = unlikely to be gallstones

### Cholangiocarcinoma

- Progressive obstructive jaundice
- May present as Klatskin tumor (at hepatic duct confluence)
