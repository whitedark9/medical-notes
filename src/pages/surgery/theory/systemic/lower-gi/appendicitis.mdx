# Acute Appendicitis

> Acute appendicitis is an **acute inflammation of the vermiform appendix**, usually due to **luminal obstruction**, and is one of the most common surgical emergencies.

## Pathology (Pathophysiology)

### Stepwise progression:

1. **Luminal obstruction**
   - _Faecolith [^2] (hard stool)_
   - _Lymphoid hyperplasia (especially in children)_
   - Foreign body, parasites (e.g. _Enterobius vermicularis_), tumour
2. **↑ Intraluminal pressure**
   - Due to continued mucus secretion with blocked outlet
   - Compresses venous drainage → congestion of wall
3. **Mucosal ischaemia**
   - Bacterial overgrowth (aerobes & anaerobes, e.g. _E. coli, Bacteroides_)
   - Inflammation of entire wall → _suppurative appendicitis_
4. **Transmural inflammation**
   - Neutrophilic infiltration
   - Serosal involvement → peritonitis [^1]
5. **Complications**
   - Gangrenous appendicitis → necrosis of wall
   - Perforation → localised abscess or generalised peritonitis
   - Appendicular mass or abscess

## Clinical Features

### A. Symptoms

1. **Pain** (classic migration pattern):
   - Initially: **Periumbilical** (visceral pain due to midgut origin)
   - Later: **Right iliac fossa (RIF)** pain (parietal peritoneal irritation)
   - Sharp, worsens with movement or coughing
2. **Anorexia** (nearly universal)
3. **Nausea ± vomiting**
4. **Low-grade fever**
5. **Constipation** (sometimes diarrhoea in children)

### B. Signs

1. **Tenderness at McBurney’s point [^3]**
   - 1/3 distance from ASIS to umbilicus
2. **Guarding** and **rebound tenderness**
   - Suggests peritoneal irritation
3. **Rovsing’s sign**
   - Pain in RIF on palpation of LIF (positive)
4. **Psoas sign**
   - Pain on extension of right hip (retrocaecal appendix)
5. **Obturator sign**
   - Pain on internal rotation of flexed right thigh (pelvic appendix)
6. **Fever and tachycardia**

### C. Atypical Presentations

- **Pelvic appendix**: urinary frequency, diarrhoea, suprapubic pain
- **Retrocaecal appendix**: less abdominal tenderness, flank or back pain
- **Elderly**: delayed presentation, higher risk of perforation
- **Pregnancy**: displaced appendix → RUQ pain

[^1]: _Peritonitis_: inflammation of peritoneum, usually due to infection or perforation.

[^2]: _Faecolith_: hardened stool obstructing appendix lumen.

[^3]: _McBurney’s point_: anatomical landmark on right lower quadrant.

## Investigations

### A. Laboratory

1. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**
   - **↑ WBC count** (usually 10,000–18,000/mm³)
   - **↑ Neutrophils** (left shift)
2. **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**
   - Elevated → supports inflammation
   - Used in scoring systems (e.g., **Alvarado score**)
3. **Serum electrolytes, urea, creatinine**
   - To assess hydration, renal function pre-op
4. **Urinalysis**
   - Rule out urinary tract infection or renal colic
5. **Pregnancy test (β-hCG)** in females of reproductive age
   - Rule out ectopic pregnancy

### B. Imaging

1. **Ultrasound Abdomen**
   - First-line, especially in children and pregnant women
   - Findings:
     - Non-compressible tubular structure >6 mm in RIF
     - Free fluid, appendicolith
2. **CT Abdomen with contrast** _(gold standard in adults)_
   - Most sensitive and specific
   - Useful in unclear cases
   - Findings:
     - Dilated appendix >6 mm
     - Wall thickening, fat stranding, abscess, perforation
3. **MRI abdomen**
   - Used in pregnancy if diagnosis unclear
   - No radiation exposure

## Management

### A. Emergency Approach

1. **A – Airway**
   - Ensure patent airway, especially if vomiting or altered mental status
2. **B – Breathing**
   - Assess for signs of respiratory distress
   - Supplemental O₂ if needed
3. **C – Circulation**
   - IV access → fluids (normal saline or Ringer's lactate)
   - Monitor vitals, treat shock if present
   - Group and crossmatch blood (if bleeding suspected)
4. **D – Disability**
   - Assess consciousness, pain control
   - IV analgesia (e.g., paracetamol, opioids)
5. **E – Exposure**
   - Examine full abdomen
   - Check for signs of generalised peritonitis or skin changes
6. **F – Fluids**
   - Start IV fluids (especially in vomiting or dehydrated patients)
   - NPO (nil per os) → prepare for surgery

### B. Definitive Treatment

#### 1. Surgical – Appendicectomy (mainstay)

##### Indications

- Confirmed or strongly suspected appendicitis
- Complicated cases: perforation, abscess, peritonitis

##### Types

1. `Open Appendicectomy`
   - McBurney’s incision
   - Preferred in complicated appendicitis
1. `Laparoscopic Appendicectomy`
   - Preferred for uncomplicated cases
   - Faster recovery, less pain, better cosmesis
1. **If abscess/mass present**:
   - Conservative management (Ochsner-Sherren regimen) ± interval appendicectomy later

#### 2. Non-surgical (selected cases)

- In selected uncomplicated cases, especially if surgery contraindicated:
  - IV antibiotics
  - Observation
  - Consider delayed appendicectomy

<details>
<summary>Ochsner-Sherren Regimen</summary>

> A **conservative (non-operative) management protocol** historically used for **appendicular mass** (a complication of acute appendicitis where an inflamed appendix is walled off by omentum and bowel).

### Indication

- **Appendicular mass** without signs of generalized peritonitis or sepsis
- Patient is clinically stable, no features of rupture or abscess formation requiring drainage

### Components

1. **Nil by Mouth (NPO)**: To rest the bowel and prevent worsening of inflammation
1. **Nasogastric Tube (NGT)**: If vomiting or evidence of ileus
1. **IV Fluids**: Maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances
1. **IV Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone + metronidazole) to control infection and reduce inflammation
1. **Monitoring**
   - Vital signs every 4-6 hours
   - Abdominal examination daily
   - Monitor WBC and CRP
   - Assess for any signs of deterioration (fever, pain, sepsis)
1. **Analgesia**: Paracetamol or other suitable pain control agents

### Expected Course

- Clinical improvement within **48-72 hours**
- Reduction in tenderness and mass size
- Fever subsides, WBC normalizes

### Elective Surgery (Interval Appendectomy)

- Usually considered **6-8 weeks** after conservative management
- Rationale: To prevent recurrence, though increasingly debated in modern practice

### Failure Criteria (Indications for Surgery)

- Persistent or worsening symptoms
- Signs of abscess formation or rupture
- Development of generalized peritonitis
- Clinical deterioration despite conservative management

### Complications if Regimen Fails

- Generalized peritonitis
- Appendicular abscess
- Intestinal obstruction
- Sepsis

### Antibiotic Therapy

- **Pre-operative**:
  - IV `ceftriaxone + metronidazole` Or `ampicillin-sulbactam`
- **Post-operative** (if perforation or abscess):
  - Continue 5–7 days IV antibiotics

### Post-operative Care

- Early mobilisation
- Pain management
- Wound care
- Watch for complications: wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess

### Complications

- **Immediate**:
  - Perforation, peritonitis, appendicular mass/abscess
- **Post-op**:
  - Wound infection
  - Intra-abdominal abscess
  - Adhesive bowel obstruction
  - Stump appendicitis (rare)
