# Appendicular Mass

<details>
<summary>Common Causes of Pain in the Right Iliac Fossa (RIF)</summary>

### 1. Gastrointestinal Causes

1. **Acute appendicitis**
   - Most common cause
   - Pain starts peri-umbilical → localizes to RIF
   - Associated with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever
2. **Meckel’s diverticulitis**
   - Congenital outpouching of distal ileum
   - Mimics appendicitis
3. **Crohn’s disease**
   - Terminal ileitis → chronic or acute RIF pain
   - Associated with diarrhea, weight loss
4. **Mesenteric adenitis**
   - Post-viral lymphadenopathy in mesentery
   - Usually in children
5. **Cecal diverticulitis**
   - Inflammation of a diverticulum in the cecum
   - Less common than sigmoid diverticulitis
6. **Colonic carcinoma (esp. cecal)**
   - Elderly, anemia, weight loss, altered bowel habits

### 2. Gynecological Causes (Females only)

1. **Ectopic pregnancy** _(ruptured or unruptured)_
   - Severe pain, amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding
   - +ve urine β-hCG
2. **Ovarian torsion**
   - Sudden severe unilateral pain, vomiting
   - Enlarged adnexa on imaging
3. **Ruptured ovarian cyst**
   - Acute onset pain, usually mid-cycle
   - Free fluid on ultrasound
4. **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)**
   - Bilateral or unilateral lower abdominal pain
   - Vaginal discharge, fever, cervical motion tenderness
5. **Mittelschmerz**
   - Mid-cycle ovulation pain
   - Mild, short-lived

### 3. Urinary Tract Causes

1. **Ureteric colic (renal stone)**
   - Colicky pain radiating from loin to groin
   - Hematuria, nausea
2. **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**
   - Dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain
   - Possible RIF pain if lower ureter involved

### 4. Musculoskeletal Causes

1. **Abdominal wall strain or hernia (e.g. inguinal hernia)**
   - Localized pain, may worsen on movement
   - Cough impulse, palpable swelling
2. **Psoas abscess**
   - Fever, back or flank pain, hip flexion deformity

### 5. Others

1. **Referred pain from hip pathology**
   - E.g. septic arthritis, osteomyelitis
2. **Torsion of undescended testis** _(if testis is intra-abdominal)_

<summary>Differential diagnosis of mass in RIF</summary>

### Gastrointestinal Causes

1. **Appendicular mass/abscess**
   - Post-acute appendicitis (delayed presentation)
   - Tender, firm, localized mass
2. **Ileocecal tuberculosis**
   - Chronic RIF mass, constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats)
   - May mimic malignancy
3. **Carcinoma of the cecum**
   - Elderly, anemia, altered bowel habits
   - Hard, irregular, non-tender mass
4. **Crohn’s disease (inflammatory mass)**
   - Thickened bowel loops, palpable mass
   - History of diarrhea, weight loss
5. **Meckel’s diverticulum (inflamed or tumor)**
   - Congenital, may form mass when inflamed
6. **Actinomycosis**
   - Rare chronic infection → firm woody mass with discharging sinuses

### Lymphatic Causes

1. **Mesenteric lymphadenopathy**
   - Due to lymphoma, tuberculosis, or viral infections
   - May be multiple, mobile, and non-tender
2. **Lymphoma (e.g. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma)**
   - Firm, rubbery mass ± systemic B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss)

### Gynecological Causes _(Females)_

1. **Ovarian mass (benign or malignant)**
   - Cyst, torsion, tumor
   - Irregular menstrual history, mass separate from bowel
2. **Tubo-ovarian abscess**
   - Secondary to PID
   - Tender mass with fever, vaginal discharge
3. **Ectopic pregnancy (chronic)**
   - Tender adnexal mass, positive β-hCG

### Urinary Causes

1. **Distended bladder (in retention)**
   - Globular suprapubic/RIF mass, dull to percussion
2. **Hydronephrosis of right kidney (low-lying or pelvic kidney)**
   - Cystic, ballotable mass
3. **Ureteric stone with perinephric urinoma**
   - Tender, possibly fluctuant RIF mass

### Musculoskeletal/Soft Tissue

1. **Psoas abscess**
   - Deep-seated mass, may cause hip flexion deformity
   - Associated with fever, back pain
2. **Abdominal wall lipoma or hematoma**
   - Superficial, soft/firm mass
   - Moves with contraction of abdominal muscles
3. **Inguinal or femoral hernia**
   - Cough impulse, reducible, can descend into scrotum/labia

### Congenital/Developmental

1. **Mesenteric cyst**
   - Rare, mobile cystic mass
2. **Undescended testis (intra-abdominal)**
   - Especially in young males
