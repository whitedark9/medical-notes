# Extradural Haematoma (EDH)

> Extradural (epidural) haematoma is a collection of blood between the inner surface of the skull and the dura mater, usually due to trauma and arterial injury, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening brain compression.

## Causes of Extradural Haematoma

1. **Trauma (most common cause)**
   - Usually associated with skull fracture (especially temporal bone)
   - Commonly affects the **middle meningeal artery** (MMA) → rapid arterial bleeding
2. **Venous bleeding**
   - Less common, from dural venous sinuses or diploic veins
   - Slower onset
3. **Post-operative**
   - After cranial surgeries due to vessel injury
4. **Spontaneous** (rare)
   - In patients on anticoagulation
   - Bleeding disorders (e.g. haemophilia)
   - Vascular malformations

## Pathophysiology

- Trauma → skull fracture → laceration of **middle meningeal artery**
  → rapid accumulation of arterial blood in extradural space
  → compression of adjacent brain tissue
  → ↑ intracranial pressure → herniation (e.g. uncal herniation) → death

## Clinical Features

1. Lucid interval:
   - Initial loss of consciousness → recovery (lucid period) → deterioration
2. Headache
3. Vomiting
4. Altered mental status
5. Seizures
6. Ipsilateral pupil dilation (due to CN III compression)
7. Hemiparesis (usually contralateral side)

## Investigation

- **CT Brain (non-contrast)**:
  - Biconvex (lentiform) hyperdense collection
  - Does not cross suture lines
  - Associated skull fracture

## Management

### A. Emergency Management

- **A – Airway**: Secure airway if GCS < 8 or airway compromised
- **B – Breathing**: Assess and support ventilation
- **C – Circulation**: Control hypotension, establish IV access, fluid resuscitation
- **D – Disability**: Neurological assessment (GCS), pupil size/reactivity
- **E – Exposure**: Full body check for other injuries
- **F – Fluids**: Maintain perfusion pressure (avoid hypotension)

### B. Definitive Management

#### a. Conservative Management

- Indication:
  - Small EDH (< 30 mL volume, < 15 mm thickness, < 5 mm midline shift)
  - GCS > 8, no focal deficit
- Monitoring:
  - Neurological observation
  - Repeat imaging

#### b. Surgical Management

##### Indications for Surgery

- Haematoma volume >30 mL
- Thickness >15 mm or midline shift >5 mm
- GCS ≤ 8 or rapid deterioration
- Focal neurological deficits (e.g. anisocoria, hemiparesis)
- Lucid interval followed by deterioration

##### Pre-operative Preparation

- Stabilize airway, breathing, circulation
- IV mannitol (osmotic diuretic) to reduce ICP if signs of herniation
- Reverse anticoagulation if present
- Consent and urgent imaging

##### Surgical Procedures

1. `Craniotomy (Preferred)`
   - Skin incision based on haematoma location (e.g. temporal)
   - Elevation of bone flap
   - Evacuation of clot and haemostasis
   - Control bleeding source (usually MMA)
   - Dura inspected but not routinely opened
   - Bone flap replaced or left off depending on brain swelling
2. `Burr Hole Evacuation` (Not preferred, limited role)
   - Only in settings with no neurosurgical facilities
   - Temporizing measure until transfer

##### Post-operative Care

- ICU monitoring
- Serial neurological exams
- Repeat CT brain in 24-48 hrs
- Manage raised ICP (head elevation, mannitol, ventilation)
- Anticonvulsants if seizure risk
- Rehabilitation for neurological deficits

## Complications

1. Brain herniation
2. Rebleeding
3. Infection (meningitis, abscess)
4. Seizures
5. Neurological deficit (permanent)

## Prognosis

- Good prognosis with early surgical intervention
- Mortality < 10% if treated promptly
- Poor outcomes associated with:
  - Delayed diagnosis
  - GCS < 5 on admission
  - Bilateral fixed dilated pupils
