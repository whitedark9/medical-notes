# Blunt Renal Injury

> Blunt renal injury refers to non-penetrating trauma to the kidney, most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls, or sports injuries.

## Classifications

**Based on the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Kidney Injury Scale (Grades I-V):**

### Grade I - Minor Injury

- Renal contusion or non-expanding subcapsular `hematoma`
- `No laceration`

### Grade II - Mild Injury

- Non-expanding perirenal `hematoma`
- < 1cm parenchymal `laceration`, no urinary extravasation

### Grade III - Moderate Injury

- `Laceration` > 1cm depth into cortex
- No collecting system injury

### Grade IV - Severe Injury

- `Laceration` extending into collecting system → urinary extravasation
- Segmental renal artery/vein injury with `contained hemorrhage`

### Grade V - Critical Injury

- `Shattered kidney`
- Avulsion of renal hilum → devascularized kidney

## Management

### 1. Initial Assessment

#### A. Airway

- Ensure airway patency; intubate if necessary

#### B. Breathing

- Monitor for associated thoracoabdominal injuries

#### C. Circulation

- **Check for hypotension and tachycardia**
- **Signs of hemorrhagic shock** → initiate IV access, fluid resuscitation

#### D. Disability

- Assess GCS; associated head or spinal injuries

#### E. Exposure

- Fully expose patient; inspect for flank bruising, hematoma, or ecchymosis

#### F. Fluid

- Start isotonic crystalloids; consider blood transfusion if ongoing bleeding

## Definitive Management

### A. Investigations

#### History

- Mechanism of trauma (fall, MVC, sports)
- Hematuria (gross or microscopic)
- Flank pain

#### Physical Examination

- Flank tenderness, ecchymosis, palpable mass
- Signs of hypovolemia or shock

#### Laboratory

- CBC: ↓ Hb if bleeding
- Urinalysis: hematuria
- Renal function tests: BUN, creatinine
- Coagulation profile

#### Imaging

- **Contrast-enhanced CT scan (gold standard)**

  - Evaluate parenchymal injury, hematoma, urinary extravasation

- **FAST** (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma): Limited utility for retroperitoneal bleeding
- **IVP** (if undergoing laparotomy and renal injury suspected)

### B. Treatment by Injury Grade

#### Grades I-III (Minor to Moderate)

- **Non-operative management**

  - Bed rest, monitor vitals, serial Hb
  - Analgesia, hydration
  - Monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding or urinoma

#### Grade IV

- **Conservative if stable**

  - Urinary extravasation → consider percutaneous nephrostomy or stenting

- **Intervention if unstable or persistent bleeding**

  - Angiographic embolization

#### Grade V

- **Surgical management if unstable or ongoing hemorrhage**

  - **Indications:**

    - Renal pedicle avulsion
    - Expanding or pulsatile retroperitoneal hematoma
    - Shattered kidney with hemodynamic instability

## Surgical Management

### Indications for Surgery

- Hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation
- Grade V injuries (pedicle avulsion, shattered kidney)
- Expanding retroperitoneal hematoma

### Pre-op Preparation

- Cross-match blood, IV access
- Imaging to localize injury
- Consent for possible nephrectomy

### Procedures

- **Renorrhaphy** (renal repair) if feasible
- **Partial nephrectomy**
- **Total nephrectomy** if kidney non-viable or bleeding uncontrollable

### Post-op Complications

- Hemorrhage
- Urinary leak or fistula
- Renal insufficiency or failure
- Hypertension (from renal ischemia or segmental infarct)

## Complications

- Delayed bleeding
- Urinoma
- Hypertension
- Infection/abscess
- Loss of renal function

## Prognosis

- Most blunt renal injuries (Grades I-III) → excellent prognosis with conservative management
- Grade IV-V injuries → guarded prognosis; depends on associated injuries and renal salvage
