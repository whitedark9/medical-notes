# Deadly Dozen of Chest Trauma

## I. Immediately Life-Threatening Injuries

> Need rapid diagnosis & treatment during _primary survey[^1]_!

1. **Airway Obstruction**
   - Cause: blood, vomitus, foreign body, facial trauma
   - Signs: stridor, hoarseness, gurgling
   - Management: suction, airway positioning, intubation or surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy)
2. **Tension Pneumothorax**
   - Air enters pleural space → ↑ intrathoracic pressure → lung collapse + mediastinal shift → ↓ venous return → shock
   - Signs: hypotension, distended neck veins, absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation (late)
   - Management: **needle decompression** (2nd ICS midclavicular) → **chest tube**
3. **Open Pneumothorax ("Sucking Chest Wound")**
   - Large chest wall defect → air enters pleural space with each breath
   - Signs: sucking sound, bubbling wound, respiratory distress
   - Management: **3-sided occlusive dressing** → **chest tube** → surgical closure
4. **Massive Hemothorax**
   - \> 1500 mL blood in pleural cavity → lung compression + hypovolemic shock
   - Signs: dullness to percussion, absent breath sounds, hypotension
   - Management: **Chest tube** (large bore, 36-40 Fr) → surgery if \> 1500 mL initial or \> 200 mL/hr x 3 hrs
5. **Flail Chest with Pulmonary Contusion**
   - ≥ 3 consecutive ribs fractured in ≥2 places → free-floating segment
   - Signs: paradoxical chest movement, hypoxia, crepitus
   - Management: **oxygen**, **pain control**, **ventilatory support**, consider surgical fixation
6. **Cardiac Tamponade**
   - Accumulation of blood in pericardial sac → ↑ intrapericardial pressure → ↓ cardiac output
   - Signs: Beck’s triad (hypotension + muffled heart sounds + distended neck veins), pulsus paradoxus
   - Management: **Pericardiocentesis** → **Thoracotomy** if unstable

## II. Potentially Life-Threatening Injuries

> Detected in _secondary survey[^2]_ or imaging!

7. **Myocardial Contusion**
   - Blunt trauma → bruising of heart muscle
   - Signs: arrhythmias, chest pain, ECG changes (like MI)
   - Management: cardiac monitoring, supportive care
8. **Aortic Injury (Traumatic Aortic Rupture)**
   - Deceleration injury (e.g. high-speed MVC) → tear at isthmus of aorta
   - Signs: chest pain, widened mediastinum on CXR
   - Management: CT angiography → **endovascular repair or open surgery**
9. **Tracheobronchial Injury**
   - Blunt/penetrating trauma → airway disruption
   - Signs: subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, air leak despite chest tube
   - Management: bronchoscopy → surgical repair
10. **Diaphragmatic Rupture**
    - Usually left-sided; abdominal organs herniate into thorax
    - Signs: bowel sounds in chest, respiratory distress
    - Management: surgical repair via laparotomy/thoracotomy
11. **Esophageal Injury**
    - Rare but serious; may occur with penetrating trauma or forceful vomiting
    - Signs: chest pain, fever, crepitus, mediastinitis
    - Diagnosis: contrast esophagography or endoscopy
    - Management: surgical repair + antibiotics
12. **Pulmonary Contusion**
    - Blunt trauma → alveolar hemorrhage and edema
    - Signs: dyspnea, hypoxia, patchy infiltrates on CXR
    - Management: oxygen, fluid restriction, ventilation if severe
