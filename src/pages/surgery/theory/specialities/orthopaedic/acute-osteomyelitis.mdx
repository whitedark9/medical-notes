# Acute Osteomyelitis

> Acute osteomyelitis is a _rapid-onset infection of bone and bone marrow_, typically caused by _hematogenous spread of bacteria_, most commonly affecting long bones (e.g., femur, tibia) in children.

## 1. Etiopathogenesis

- **Common causative organisms:**

  - _Staphylococcus aureus_ (most common)
  - _Group A Streptococcus_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
  - _Kingella kingae_ (esp. in children \<4 years)
  - _Salmonella spp._ (esp. in sickle cell disease)

- **Route of infection:**

  - Hematogenous → Bacteremia seeds metaphysis of long bones (rich blood supply, sluggish flow)
  - Direct inoculation → Trauma or surgery
  - Contiguous spread → From adjacent soft tissue infection

- **Pathophysiology:**

  - Bacteremia → Localizes in metaphysis → Inflammatory response
    → Pus formation → ↑ Intraosseous pressure → Vascular compromise
    → Bone necrosis (sequestrum) → New bone formation (involucrum)

## 2. Clinical Features

- **General:**

  - Acute onset of fever, malaise

- **Local:**

  - Pain in affected limb (right thigh)
  - Swelling, warmth, erythema over femur
  - Refusal to bear weight / limp
  - Limited range of motion

- **Systemic signs may be present** in severe infection

## 3. Diagnosis

### A. Clinical Diagnosis

- Based on classic signs (fever, bone pain, refusal to move limb)

### B. Investigations

#### **For Diagnosis:**

- **CBC** → ↑ WBC count (neutrophilic leukocytosis)
- **ESR, CRP** → Elevated (nonspecific but useful to monitor)
- **Blood culture** → Positive in 40–60% of cases
- **X-ray femur** (may be normal early; changes after 7–10 days)

  - Periosteal elevation, lytic lesions later

- **MRI** (best modality for early detection)

  - Bone marrow edema, abscess formation

- **Bone aspiration/biopsy** → For microbiological diagnosis if blood culture negative

#### **For Causes:**

- Blood culture → Identify causative organism
- Sickle cell screening → If Salmonella suspected

#### **For Complications:**

- X-ray or MRI → Detect sequestrum, involucrum, pathological fracture
- Ultrasound → Detect subperiosteal abscess

## 4. Differential Diagnosis

- Septic arthritis → Joint effusion, more painful joint movement
- Bone tumor (Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma) → Gradual onset, systemic symptoms less common
- Cellulitis → Involves soft tissues, not bone

## 5. Management

### A. Emergency Management

- `A`irway: Ensure patent airway
- `B`reathing: Assess for respiratory distress if septicemia
- `C`irculation: IV fluids, monitor vitals, BP
- `D`rugs: Empirical IV antibiotics after cultures

  - _1st line_: IV cloxacillin or cefazolin
  - _Add vancomycin_ if MRSA suspected

- `E`valuation: Labs, imaging, surgical consult
- `F`ever control: Antipyretics

### B. Definitive Treatment

#### 1. Medical

- IV antibiotics × 1–2 weeks → Then oral antibiotics × 4–6 weeks
- Monitor CRP, ESR for response

#### 2. Surgical

##### Indications

- Failure of IV antibiotics after **48–72 hours**
- **Subperiosteal or intramedullary abscess** (seen on MRI or US)
- Formation of **sequestrum** (dead bone)
- Signs of **impending compartment syndrome**
- **Joint involvement** (to prevent septic arthritis)
- Persistent **toxicity or bacteremia** despite antibiotics
- **Diagnostic biopsy** when diagnosis uncertain

##### A. Pre-operative Preparation

- **Informed consent**: Explain risks, benefits, possible need for repeat surgery
- **Localise infection**: MRI or US to define extent, locate abscess or sequestrum
- **Blood culture results** reviewed
- **Baseline labs**:

  - CBC, CRP, ESR
  - Renal function, coagulation profile

- **Cross-match blood** (rarely needed, but precautionary)
- **IV antibiotics** continued up to surgery

##### B. Operative Procedures

1. Surgical Drainage

   - For **subperiosteal/intramedullary abscess**
   - Incision over the most affected site (often lateral thigh for femur)
   - **Periosteal elevation** to expose bone
   - Drill or cortical window to access medulla
   - Drain pus, irrigate with normal saline
   - Send pus for Gram stain, culture, and histology

1. Sequestrectomy

   - Indicated if sequestrum visible (typically 2–3 weeks after onset)
   - Remove dead bone and surrounding granulation tissue
   - Preserve viable bone and periosteum to allow new bone formation

1. Curettage

   - Scraping of necrotic medullary bone if no clear sequestrum
   - Often done along with drainage

1. Stabilisation (if pathological fracture present or extensive debridement)

   - Internal or external fixation (rare in acute setting)

##### C. Post-operative Care

- **IV antibiotics** continued 2–3 weeks, then switch to oral for 4–6 weeks

  - Tailor based on culture sensitivity

- **Wound care**: Daily dressing or negative pressure wound therapy (if large wound)
- **Monitoring:**

  - Daily temperature, CRP, ESR weekly
  - Wound inspection for pus or signs of infection

- **Physiotherapy**: Early mobilisation with limb support to prevent contractures
- **Nutritional support**: High-protein diet for wound and bone healing
- **Follow-up imaging**: To monitor for healing or recurrence

##### D. Post-operative Complications

- Bleeding
- Recurrence of infection
- Pathological fracture
- Growth disturbance (if physis involved)

## 6. Prognosis & Complications

### A. Complications

- Chronic osteomyelitis (sequestrum, sinus tract)
- Growth disturbance → Epiphyseal damage
- Pathological fracture
- Septic arthritis (especially in infants)
- Systemic sepsis

## 7. Prevention

- Early diagnosis and treatment
- Adequate antibiotic coverage for high-risk infections
