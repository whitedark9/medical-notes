# Orthopaedic Emergencies

> Orthopaedic emergencies are musculoskeletal conditions requiring **urgent diagnosis and management** to prevent **permanent disability, limb loss, or death**.

## 1. **Vascular Compromise**

- **Compartment syndrome**

  - ↑ intracompartmental pressure → ↓ perfusion → muscle & nerve ischemia
  - _5 Ps_: Pain (out of proportion), Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis

- **Fracture with arterial injury**

  - e.g. supracondylar fracture in children → brachial artery injury
  - limb ischemia if delayed

- **Dislocations with vascular injury**

  - knee dislocation → popliteal artery injury
  - shoulder dislocation → axillary artery injury (rare)

## 2. **Neurovascular Compromise**

- **Closed fracture/dislocation compressing a nerve or vessel**

  - urgent reduction needed
  - e.g. posterior elbow dislocation compressing brachial artery

## 3. **Open Fractures**

- Communication between fracture and environment → infection risk
- Urgent debridement, antibiotics, fracture stabilization needed

## 4. **Septic Arthritis**

- Infection within joint → rapid cartilage destruction
- Joint aspiration, IV antibiotics, surgical washout
- Common in: hip/knee (children), prosthetic joints (adults)

## 5. **Osteomyelitis (Acute)**

- Especially in children or diabetics
- Painful swelling, fever, refusal to use limb
- Requires IV antibiotics ± surgical drainage

## 6. **Cauda Equina Syndrome**

- Compression of cauda equina nerves (e.g. from disc prolapse, tumor, hematoma)
- Symptoms:

  - Saddle anesthesia
  - Urinary retention or incontinence
  - Bilateral leg weakness/sciatica

- **Emergency MRI + decompression**

## 7. **Spinal Cord Compression**

- Causes: trauma, tumor, epidural abscess
- Signs: back pain, limb weakness, bladder/bowel disturbance
- **Emergency imaging (MRI) + decompression**

## 8. **Unstable Spine Fractures**

- E.g. cervical spine injury after trauma
- Risk of spinal cord injury → immobilize, urgent imaging & stabilization

## 9. **Pelvic Fractures (unstable/bleeding)**

- High-energy trauma (e.g., RTAs) → pelvic ring disruption → massive hemorrhage
- Emergency: pelvic binder, resuscitation, angioembolization/surgery

## 10. **Necrotizing Fasciitis**

- Rapidly spreading soft tissue infection
- Pain out of proportion, skin changes, systemic toxicity
- Requires emergency surgical debridement + IV antibiotics

## 11. **Tetanus (from contaminated wounds)**

- Uncontrolled muscle spasms, trismus (lockjaw)
- Prophylaxis in high-risk wounds, especially open fractures
- Emergency: tetanus immunoglobulin, wound care, muscle relaxants

### Quick Mnemonic: **"CAN STOP NOW"**

- **C** – Compartment syndrome
- **A** – Arterial injury
- **N** – Nerve injury causing deficit
- **S** – Septic arthritis
- **T** – Tetanus risk wounds
- **O** – Open fracture
- **P** – Pelvic fracture with bleeding
- **N** – Necrotizing fasciitis
- **O** – Osteomyelitis (acute)
- **W** – Weakness from spinal cord compression
