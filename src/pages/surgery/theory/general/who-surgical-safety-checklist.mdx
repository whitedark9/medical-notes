# WHO Surgical Safety Checklist

> A structured tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to improve surgical safety by reducing complications, infections, and mortality.

> Ensures effective communication and adherence to safety protocols among surgical teams.

## Structure of the Checklist

1. Sign In (Before Anesthesia Induction)
1. Time Out (Before Skin Incision - Team Pause)
1. Sign Out (Before Leaving OR)

### 1. Sign In (Before Anesthesia Induction)

- ✅ Confirm **patient identity** (Name, DOB, Hospital ID).
- ✅ Confirm **procedure and surgical site** (Marking if required).
- ✅ Confirm **patient consent** is signed.
- ✅ Check **allergies** (e.g., latex, medications).
- ✅ Check **airway risk** (Mallampati score, difficult intubation).
- ✅ Assess **aspiration risk** (NPO status, reflux disease).
- ✅ Review **anesthesia safety check** (machine, drugs, monitoring).

### 2. Time Out (Before Skin Incision - Team Pause)

- ✅ **Introduce all team members** by name and role.
- ✅ Confirm **patient identity, procedure, and surgical site** again.
- ✅ Verify **antibiotic prophylaxis** (given within 60 min if needed).
- ✅ Discuss **critical steps and potential complications**.
- ✅ Ensure **necessary imaging** (X-ray, CT, MRI) is available.
- ✅ Confirm **DVT prophylaxis** (compression devices, LMWH if indicated).

### 3. Sign Out (Before Leaving OR)

- ✅ Confirm **procedure performed** matches the planned procedure.
- ✅ Count **instruments, needles, and sponges** (to prevent retained surgical items).
- ✅ Label **specimens correctly** (patient name, site, type).
- ✅ Check for **equipment malfunctions** (document issues if any).
- ✅ Discuss **post-op care plan**, monitoring needs, and recovery instructions.

## Benefits of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist

- ✔ **Reduces surgical complications** and mortality.
- ✔ **Prevents wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-patient errors.**
- ✔ **Enhances teamwork and communication** among surgical staff.
- ✔ **Improves efficiency** and preparedness in the operating room.
- ✔ **Increases compliance** with infection prevention (antibiotics, sterility).
