# Chronic Ischemic Lower Limbs

> A condition of severe and persistent reduction (≥ 2 weeks) of blood flow to the lower limbs, leading to pain, non-healing wounds, and potentially limb loss.

## Rutherford Classification

| Grade | Category | Description           |
| :---- | :------- | :-------------------- |
| 0     | 0        | Asymptomatic          |
| I     | 1        | Mild claudication     |
| I     | 2        | Moderate claudication |
| I     | 3        | Severe claudication   |
| II    | 4        | Rest pain             |
| III   | 5        | Minor tissue loss     |
| III   | 6        | Major tissue loss     |

## Causes

1. Atherosclerosis
1. Buerger's disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans)
1. Entrapment syndromes
1. Vasculitis
1. Radiation-induced arterial damage
1. Hypercoagulable states
1. Diabetes mellitus
1. Chronic kidney disease
1. Connective tissue disease

## Clinical Features

1. **Intermittent claudication**
   - Anaerobic muscle metabolism
   - Cramp-like pain felt in the muscles
   - Muscle group affected by claudication is classically one anatomical level below the level of arterial disease
1. **Rest pain**
   - Anaerobic respiration at rest
   - Typically affect the foot and/or calf
   - Exacerbated by lying down or elevation of the foot
1. **Ulceration**
   - Severe arterial insufficiency
   - Painful erosions between the toes
   - Non-healing ulcers on the dorsum of the feet, shins and around the malleoli
1. **Gangrene**
   - Obstructed circulation or bacterial infection → Localized death and decomposition of body tissue
1. **Dependent rubor or sunset foot**
   - Patients with CLTI
   - Foot pallor on elevation of limb
   - Red/purple colour on dependency (hanging down)
1. **Arterial pulsation diminished or absent**
   - Femoral, Popliteal, Posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries
   - Pulsation distal to an arterial occlusion is usually absent
   - Present if highly developed collateral circulation exists
1. **Slow capillary refilling**
   - Normal 2-3 seconds
   - Prolong to 10 secs in severe ischemia
1. **Arterial bruit**
   - Present → Turbulent flow → Stenosis
   - Unreliable clinical sign
   - Tight stenosis often do not have bruits

> Patients with ischaemic rest pain with or without ulceration/gangrene

> Require urgent vascular assessment or revascularization to prevent major amputation!!!

## Investigation

### 1. Laboratory

1. Blood tests
1. Full blood count
1. Blood glucose
1. Lipid profile
1. Serum urea and electrolytes
1. Serum creatinine and eGFR
1. ECG, Exercised ECG
1. Echocardiography
1. ABG, Pulmonary function test

### 2. Imaging

1. **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**
   - Ratio of the systolic pressure at the ankle to that in the ipsilateral arm
   - `Normal`: 0.9 - 1.4
   - `Haemodynamically significant arterial lesion`: < 0.9
   - `CLTI`: < 0.4
1. **Doppler ultrasound blood flow detection**
   - Can measure blood pressure of small arteries in conjunction with sphygmomanometer
1. **Duplex Doppler ultrasound (DUS)**
   - Cost-effectiveness, Safety
1. **Digital subtraction percutaneous angiography (DSA)**
1. **Computed tomography angiography (CTA)**
   - In revascularization procedures, CTA helps surgeon for visualization
1. **Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)**
   - No ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast
   - For highly calcified vessels

## Management

### 1. General

> Presence of arterial disease in the leg suggests disease in other arterial trees (coronary 50%, cerebral 25-50%).

1. Prevention of major cardiovascular morbidity through risk factor modification
   Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia
1. Symptom relief/improvement

### 2. Non-Surgical

1. Drugs
   - Anti-platelet therapy (`Aspirin` 75 mg OD, `Clopidogrel` 75 mg OD)
   - Lipid lowering therapy (`Atorvastatin`, `Rosuvastatin`)
   - Vasodilators are not effective
   - Beta-blockers is contraindicated in hypertensive patients with chronic ischemia
1. Transluminal angioplasty
   - Insert a ballon catheter into an artery and inflate it
1. Stenting
   - Self expanding metal stent (SEMS)

### 3. Surgical

#### Bypass Surgery

| Ischemia                                  | Bypass                                         |
| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Aorto-iliac occlusion                     | Aorto-bifemoral bypass                         |
| Aorto-iliac occlusion (in unfit patients) | Axillo-bifemoral bypass                        |
| Only one iliac system occlusion           | Ilio-femoral or femoro-femoral crossover graft |
| Superficial femoral artery disease        | Femoro-popliteral bypass                       |
| Diabetes with CLTI                        | Femoro-distal bypass                           |

#### Amputation

#### Indications
