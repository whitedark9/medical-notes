# Post-Operative Fever

> Fever (≥38.5°C) occurring after surgery, often due to inflammatory, infectious, or thrombotic causes.

## Causes

### Immediate (0-24 hours)

1. Inflammatory response to surgery
1. Malignant hyperthermia (reaction to anesthetics)
1. Blood transfusion reaction (hemolytic or febrile non-hemolytic)
1. Surgical trauma-related inflammation
1. Pre-existing infection (e.g., undiagnosed pneumonia, sepsis)

### Acute (1-7 days)

1. Nosocomial infections (hospital-acquired infections)
1. Aspiration pneumonia
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) (from catheterization)
1. Wound infection (superficial or deep)
1. Thrombophlebitis (IV catheter-related infection)
1. _Clostridioides difficile_ colitis (antibiotic-associated colitis)

### Subacute (8-30 days)

1. Surgical site infections (deep or organ-space infections)
1. Catheter-related bloodstream infections
1. Drug fever (immune-mediated reaction to medications)
1. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
1. Anastomotic leak (especially in gastrointestinal surgeries)
1. Postoperative abscess formation

### Delayed (> 30 days)

1. Chronic surgical site infections (e.g., infected mesh, osteomyelitis)
1. Prosthetic device infection (e.g., joint prosthesis, cardiac valves)
1. Endocarditis (especially in patients with prosthetic valves or IV drug use)
1. Tuberculosis reactivation
1. Chronic viral infections (e.g., viral hepatitis, CMV reactivation in immunocompromised patients)

## Management

## 1. Immediate (0-24 hours)

1. Inflammatory response to surgery → Supportive care (antipyretics if needed)
1. Malignant hyperthermia →
   - ABCDEF approach (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure, Fluids)
   - Stop triggering anesthetic agents
   - Administer dantrolene IV
   - Cool the patient (cold IV fluids, cooling blankets)
   - Manage acidosis, hyperkalemia, and rhabdomyolysis
1. Blood transfusion reaction →
   - Stop transfusion immediately
   - Give IV fluids and supportive care
   - Administer antihistamines, steroids, or epinephrine if allergic reaction
   - Monitor for hemolysis, renal failure
1. Surgical trauma-related inflammation → Observation, symptomatic treatment
1. Pre-existing infection → Treat underlying infection (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis)

## 2. Acute (1-7 days)

1. Nosocomial infections (hospital-acquired infections) →
   - Identify source (blood culture, urine culture, CXR)
   - Initiate `empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics` (adjust based on culture results)
1. Aspiration pneumonia →
   - Oxygen support, suctioning
   - `Empiric antibiotics`
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) →
   - Remove or replace catheter if needed
   - Urine culture → `targeted antibiotics`
1. Wound infection (superficial or deep) →
   - Open and drain wound if purulent
   - `Antibiotics` if cellulitis or systemic signs of infection
1. Thrombophlebitis (IV catheter-related infection) →
   - Remove IV catheter
   - Culture catheter tip and blood
   - Empiric IV antibiotics (`vancomycin` for MRSA coverage)
1. Clostridioides difficile colitis →
   - Oral `vancomycin` or `fidaxomicin`
   - Isolate patient, discontinue unnecessary antibiotics

## 3. Subacute (8-30 days)

1. Surgical site infections (deep or organ-space infections) →
   - Imaging (CT, ultrasound) to detect abscess
   - Drainage of abscess
   - Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics
1. Catheter-related bloodstream infections →
   - Remove central venous catheter
   - Blood cultures → targeted IV antibiotics
1. Drug fever →
   - Stop suspected medication
   - Supportive care
1. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) →
   - Anticoagulation (`heparin`/`LMWH`, then `warfarin` or `DOACs`)
   - Consider thrombectomy if massive PE
1. Anastomotic leak (GI surgeries) →
   - NPO (nil per os), IV fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - Surgical re-exploration if needed
1. Postoperative abscess formation →
   - Percutaneous or surgical drainage
   - `IV antibiotics`

## 4. Delayed (>30 days)

1. Chronic surgical site infections (e.g., infected mesh, osteomyelitis) →
   - `Surgical debridement`
   - `Long-term antibiotics` based on culture
1. Prosthetic device infection (joint prosthesis, cardiac valves) →
   - Device removal if severe infection
   - `IV antibiotics` for 6+ weeks
1. Endocarditis →
   - Blood cultures
   - `IV antibiotics` for 4-6 weeks
   - Surgery if heart failure, large vegetations, or uncontrolled infection
1. Tuberculosis reactivation →
   - `Anti-TB therapy`
1. Chronic viral infections (e.g., CMV reactivation) →
   - `IV ganciclovir` or `valganciclovir`
