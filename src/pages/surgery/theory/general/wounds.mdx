# Wounds

## Phases of Wound Healing

Wound healing occurs in **four overlapping phases**:

1. Hemostasis (Immediate - Minutes)
1. Inflammatory Phase (0-4 Days)
1. Proliferative Phase (4-21 Days)
1. Remodeling (Maturation) Phase (21 Days - 1 Year)

### 1. Hemostasis (Immediate - Minutes)

- **Purpose**: Stops bleeding and forms a clot.
- **Process**:
  - **Vasoconstriction** → Reduces blood loss.
  - **Platelet Aggregation** → Forms a temporary plug.
  - **Coagulation Cascade Activation** → Fibrin clot formation stabilizes the wound.

### 2. Inflammatory Phase (0-4 Days)

- **Purpose**: Prevents infection and initiates tissue repair.
- **Process**:
  - **Vasodilation** → Brings immune cells to the wound.
  - **Neutrophil Infiltration** → Clears bacteria and necrotic tissue.
  - **Macrophage Infiltration** → Phagocytosis and cytokine release for healing.
  - **Redness, warmth, swelling, and pain** are common signs.

### 3. Proliferative Phase (4-21 Days)

- **Purpose**: Tissue formation and wound closure.
- **Process**:
  - **Fibroblast Activation** → Produces collagen for tissue strength.
  - **Angiogenesis** → Formation of new blood vessels.
  - **Granulation Tissue Formation** → Provides a base for new epithelial cells.
  - **Epithelialization** → Keratinocytes migrate to cover the wound.

### 4. Remodeling (Maturation) Phase (21 Days - 1 Year)

- **Purpose**: Strengthening and scar formation.
- **Process**:
  - **Collagen Remodeling** → Type III collagen is replaced by Type I.
  - **Decreased Vascularity** → Reduced redness.
  - **Scar Formation** → Tensile strength improves but never reaches 100% of original tissue.

## Factors Influencing Wound Healing

| Category     | Factors That Delay Healing                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local**    | Infection, ischemia, necrosis, mechanical stress, desiccation/maceration                                                            |
| **Systemic** | Age, diabetes, malnutrition, obesity, chronic diseases, immunosuppression, medications, smoking, alcohol, stress, sleep deprivation |

### Local Factors

#### 1. Infection

- **Bacteria** (e.g., _Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa_) release toxins that **prolong inflammation**, destroy tissue, and delay healing.
- **Biofilm Formation** → Bacteria create a protective layer, making infections harder to treat.
- **Clinical Signs**: Increased redness, warmth, pus, foul odor, delayed granulation tissue formation.

#### 2. Ischemia & Hypoxia

- Oxygen is **critical for collagen synthesis, fibroblast function, and angiogenesis**.
- **Causes of Ischemia**:
  - **Atherosclerosis** → Reduces arterial blood flow.
  - **Diabetes Mellitus** → Microvascular damage leads to poor oxygenation.
  - **Smoking** → Causes vasoconstriction and reduces oxygen delivery.
  - **Chronic Venous Insufficiency** → Leads to edema and impaired wound healing.

#### 3. Foreign Bodies & Necrotic Tissue

- **Foreign bodies** (sutures, implants, debris) act as a nidus for infection.
- **Necrotic tissue** → Prevents epithelial migration, delays granulation, and increases infection risk.
- **Management**: **Debridement** (surgical, enzymatic, or autolytic) to remove non-viable tissue.

#### 4. Wound Tension & Mechanical Stress

- **Excessive tension on sutures** → Can lead to **wound dehiscence**.
- **High mobility areas** (joints, abdomen) → More prone to delayed healing.
- **Repeated trauma** (rubbing, dressings) → Disrupts epithelialization.

#### 5. Moisture Balance

- **Desiccation (Too Dry)** → Epithelial cells cannot migrate across the wound bed.
- **Excess Moisture (Too Wet)** → Maceration of the wound edges, increases infection risk.
- **Optimal Moisture** → Promotes fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and keratinocyte migration.

### Systemic Factors

#### 1. Age

- **Older adults** → Delayed healing due to:
  - **Decreased fibroblast activity** → Slower collagen deposition.
  - **Reduced immune function** → Increased risk of infections.
  - **Reduced skin elasticity & vascularization** → Poor tissue regeneration.

#### 2. Malnutrition & Deficiencies

- **Protein Deficiency** → Reduces collagen synthesis and immune function.
- **Vitamin C Deficiency** → Impairs collagen cross-linking → Weak scar formation (Scurvy).
- **Zinc Deficiency** → Reduces fibroblast proliferation and epithelialization.
- **Iron Deficiency** → Impairs oxygen delivery → Slower cell turnover.

#### 3. Obesity

- **Adipose tissue is poorly vascularized** → Decreased oxygen supply.
- **Increased inflammation** → Chronic low-grade inflammation impairs healing.
- **Higher risk of dehiscence & infection** due to poor wound perfusion.

#### 4. Smoking & Alcohol

- **Smoking** → Nicotine causes **vasoconstriction**, reduces oxygen delivery, and **impairs macrophage function**.
- **Alcohol** → Causes **dehydration**, weakens immune response, and **reduces protein synthesis**.

#### 5. Psychological Stress & Sleep Deprivation

- **Increased Cortisol Levels** → Suppress immune function and fibroblast activity.
- **Poor Sleep** → Reduces growth hormone release → Delayed tissue repair.

#### 6. Diabetes Mellitus

- **Hyperglycemia** → Impairs neutrophil function → Increased risk of infection.
- **Microvascular Disease** → Reduces blood supply and oxygen delivery.
- **Neuropathy** → Loss of sensation → Delayed recognition of wounds (e.g., diabetic foot ulcers).

#### 7. Chronic Diseases

- **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** → Impaired platelet function, anemia, and uremic toxins delay healing.
- **Liver Disease** → Reduces clotting factors and albumin → Delayed wound repair.
- **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)** → Reduces arterial blood flow → Poor healing in lower limbs.

#### 8. Immunosuppression

- **HIV/AIDS** → Decreased immune response → Poor infection control.
- **Cancer** → Malignancies can **consume nutrients**, leading to cachexia and poor healing.
- **Chemotherapy & Radiation**:
  - **Chemotherapy** → Kills rapidly dividing cells, including fibroblasts and keratinocytes.
  - **Radiation** → Causes tissue fibrosis, destroys microvasculature, and leads to chronic wounds.

#### 9. Medications

- **Corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone)**
  - Suppress inflammation → Delays fibroblast migration.
  - Reduces collagen synthesis → Weak scars.
- **NSAIDs (e.g., Ibuprofen, Aspirin)**
  - Inhibit prostaglandin production → May delay healing.
- **Anticoagulants (e.g., Heparin, Warfarin)**
  - Increase bleeding risk → Hematoma formation delays healing.
- **Chemotherapeutic Agents**
  - Suppress cell division → Slow epithelialization and fibroblast function.
