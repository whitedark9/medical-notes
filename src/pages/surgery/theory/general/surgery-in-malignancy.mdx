# Role of Surgery in the Management of Malignancy

> Surgery plays a crucial role in the management of malignancies and can be used for various purposes, including diagnosis, treatment, and palliation.

1. Curative Surgery
1. Palliative Surgery
1. Prophylactic Surgery
1. Diagnostic Surgery
1. Staging Surgery
1. Reconstructive Surgery
1. Minimally Invasive and Robotic Surgery
1. Emergency Surgery

## 1. Curative Surgery

- Goal: Complete removal of the tumor with negative margins to prevent recurrence.
- Types:
  - `Radical resection` → Removal of the entire tumor with surrounding tissues and lymph nodes (e.g., radical mastectomy, Whipple's procedure).
  - `Debulking (cytoreductive) surgery` → Reducing tumor load to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy/radiotherapy (e.g., advanced ovarian cancer).
  - `Exenteration` → Removal of multiple organs in locally invasive cancers (e.g., pelvic exenteration for advanced cervical cancer).

## 2. Diagnostic Surgery

- Goal: Confirm malignancy and determine histological type and staging.
- Techniques:
  - `Excisional biopsy` → Removing the entire lesion (used in small tumors like early melanoma).
  - `Incisional biopsy` → Removing part of the lesion (used in large or deep tumors).
  - `Needle biopsy` → Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or core needle biopsy for tissue diagnosis.

## 3. Staging Surgery

- Goal: Determine tumor extent and spread for proper treatment planning.
- Examples:
  - Lymph node dissection in breast or colorectal cancer.
  - Laparoscopy in ovarian or gastric cancer to assess peritoneal spread.

## 4. Palliative Surgery

- Goal: Relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in advanced cancer.
- Examples:
  - `Bowel bypass or stoma` for obstructive colorectal cancer.
  - `Gastrostomy` for dysphagia due to esophageal cancer.
  - `Nerve decompression` in metastatic spinal cord compression.

## 5. Prophylactic (Preventive) Surgery

- Goal: Remove organs or tissues at high risk of malignancy.
- Examples:
  - `Prophylactic mastectomy` in BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers.
  - `Prophylactic colectomy` in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

## 6. Reconstructive Surgery

- Goal: Restore function and appearance after cancer removal.
- Examples:
  - `Breast reconstruction` after mastectomy.
  - `Microvascular free flap` reconstruction after head and neck cancer surgery.

## 7. Minimally Invasive and Robotic Surgery

- Goal: Reduce morbidity while achieving effective tumor removal.
- Techniques:
  - `Laparoscopic colectomy` for colorectal cancer.
  - `Robotic prostatectomy` for localized prostate cancer.
  - `Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)` for hepatic metastases.

## 8. Emergency Surgery

- Goal: Manage life-threatening complications.
- Examples:
  - `Bowel perforation` in advanced colorectal cancer.
  - `Tumor bleeding` (e.g., gastrectomy in bleeding gastric cancer).
  - `Acute airway obstruction` due to laryngeal tumor.

### Conclusion

- Surgery remains a cornerstone in cancer management, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
- The choice of surgical intervention depends on the tumor type, stage, and patient condition.
