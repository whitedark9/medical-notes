# Burns

> A burn is **tissue injury** caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, radiation, or friction, leading to **cellular destruction**, inflammation, fluid loss, and possible systemic effects.

## Causes

> FREnCH

- **Thermal (Heat)**: flame, scald, contact with hot objects.
- **Chemical**: acids, alkalis.
- **Electrical**: low or high voltage.
- **Radiation**: sunburn, radiotherapy.
- **Friction**: abrasion generating heat.

## Classification

### A. By Depth

| Type                              | Other Name | Involved Structures                  | Appearance                 | Sensation    | Healing           | Scar? |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ----- |
| **Superficial**                   | 1st degree | Epidermis only                       | Red, dry, blanches         | Painful      | 5 - 7 days        | No    |
| **Superficial Partial Thickness** | 2nd degree | Epidermis + upper dermis             | Blistered, moist, red      | Very painful | 10 - 14 days      | Rare  |

| **Full Thickness**                | 3rd degree | Epidermis + full dermis (± subcutis) | Dry, leathery, white/brown | Painless     | Requires grafting | Yes   |
| **4th Degree**                    | —          | Extends to muscle, bone              | Charred, black, eschar     | Painless     | Surgical excision | Yes   |

### B. By Extent: Total Body Surface Area (TBSA)

#### Wallace Rule of Nines (Adult)

| Region             | % TBSA |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Head & neck        | 9%     |
| Each upper limb    | 9%     |
| Each lower limb    | 18%    |
| Anterior trunk     | 18%    |
| Posterior trunk    | 18%    |
| Perineum/genitalia | 1%     |

> **Modified in children** (e.g. Lund-Browder chart)

#### Rule of Palm

> Patient's palm including fingers \~ 1% of TBSA

### C. By Severity (Used to guide referral)

| Severity     | Criteria                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minor**    | < 10% TBSA (adult), < 5% (child/elderly), superficial or superficial partial                            |
| **Moderate** | 10 - 20% TBSA, partial thickness                                                                        |
| **Major**    | > 20% TBSA, full thickness, face/hands/genitals/circumferential, inhalational/electrical/chemical burns |

### Zones of a Burn (Jackson's burn wound model)

1. **Zone of Coagulation** → central, irreversible necrosis
1. **Zone of Stasis** → surrounding, potentially salvageable
1. **Zone of Hyperaemia** → outermost, vasodilation, recovers

## Management

### Emergency Management

#### A. Airway

- Assess for airway burns (hoarseness, facial burns, singed nasal hairs, carbonaceous sputum).
- Early **intubation** if airway involvement suspected.

#### B. Breathing

- Monitor SpO₂, chest expansion.
- Suspect **inhalation injury** → administer 100% oxygen (even if SpO₂ normal due to CO poisoning).

#### C. Circulation

- Establish **2 large-bore IV lines**.
- Begin **fluid resuscitation** if **>10–15% TBSA** burns in adults or **>10% TBSA in children**.
- Monitor HR, BP, **urine output (target: 0.5–1 mL/kg/h)**.

#### D. Disability

- Assess neurological status (rule out associated head injury).
- Blood glucose in children.

#### E. Exposure

- Fully expose patient but prevent **hypothermia**.
- Estimate %TBSA burned (Rule of Nines / Lund-Browder Chart).
- Check for **other injuries**.

#### F. Fluids (Resuscitation)

- Use the Parkland formula.

### Fluid Resuscitation: **Parkland Formula**

> **4 mL × body weight (kg) × %TBSA burned**

> Use only **partial + full thickness burns**, not superficial!

- Fluid used: **Ringer’s Lactate** (preferred)
- Give **50% of total volume in first 8 hours** (from time of burn, not from admission).
- Give **remaining 50% over next 16 hours**.

#### Example:

Patient with **30% TBSA burn**, **weight = 70 kg**:

> **4 × 70 × 30 = `8400 mL`** in 24 hours<br/>First 8 hours: `4200 mL`<br/>Next 16 hours: `4200 mL`

#### Monitoring During Resuscitation

| Parameter    | Target                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Urine output | 0.5–1 mL/kg/hr (adults)      |
| Vital signs  | HR < 120 bpm, MAP > 65 mmHg  |
| Central line | May be needed in large burns |
| Electrolytes | Monitor Na⁺, K⁺, acid-base   |

#### Supportive Management

#### A. Wound Care

- Clean with saline.
- Apply topical antimicrobials (e.g., `silver sulfadiazine`).
- Dressings: non-adherent or biosynthetic as needed.
- **3rd degree burn**:
  1. Split-thickness skin graft (STSG)
  1. Full-thickness skin graft (FTSG)
  1. Cultured epithelial autograft (CEA)
  1. Allograft/Xenograft
- **4th degree burn**: Surgical excision

#### B. Analgesia

- IV opioids (e.g., morphine).
- Avoid IM/SC injections (unreliable absorption).

#### C. Tetanus Prophylaxis

- Give toxoid or TIG as needed.

#### D. Nutritional Support

- Early **enteral feeding** (within 24 hours if >20% TBSA burned).
- Increased caloric needs due to **hypermetabolism**.
