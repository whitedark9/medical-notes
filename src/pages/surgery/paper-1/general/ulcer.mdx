# Ulcer

> A discontinuity of the surface epithelium (skin or mucous membrane) due to molecular death of cells, associated with sloughing of necrotic tissue, leading to an open sore.

## Classification of Ulcer Edges

1. **Sloping edge**

- Seen when healing is in progress → granulation tissue can grow over the surface
- Example: Healing traumatic ulcer, healing venous ulcer

2. **Punched-out edge**

- Steep edge with abrupt transition from normal to ulcer floor
- Example: Syphilitic ulcer, trophic ulcer, arterial (ischemic) ulcer

3. **Undermined edge**

- Overhanging edge where the base is wider than surface opening (due to tissue destruction underneath)
- Example: Tuberculous ulcer

4. **Rolled (beaded) edge**

- Edge is rounded, smooth, and rolled inwards → due to epithelial overgrowth
- Example: Basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer)

5. **Raised and everted edge**

- Edge raised above skin level and turned outward, due to rapidly proliferating tissue
- Example: Squamous cell carcinoma ulcer

6. **Inflamed edge**

- Surrounding area red, edematous, tender → acute inflammation
- Example: Traumatic ulcer, pyogenic ulcer

**Diabetic Foot Ulcer**
Definition:

- Ulceration of the foot in a patient with diabetes mellitus, resulting from neuropathy, ischemia, and/or infection.

## Management of Diabetic Foot Ulcer

### 1. General principles

- Strict control of **blood glucose** (insulin optimization, oral hypoglycemics adjustment)
- Treat comorbidities → hypertension, dyslipidemia, renal impairment
- Patient education → foot hygiene, daily inspection, proper footwear, avoidance of trauma

### 2. Local wound care

- **Debridement**

  - Surgical debridement of necrotic tissue and callus
  - Enzymatic/chemical debridement if surgery not suitable

- **Dressings**

  - Moist wound-healing environment (hydrocolloid, alginate dressings)
  - Avoid antiseptics like iodine/hydrogen peroxide (delay healing)

- **Negative pressure wound therapy (VAC)** in selected cases

### 3. Infection control

- **Culture & sensitivity** from deep tissue (not superficial swab)
- **Antibiotics**:

  - Mild → oral broad spectrum (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin)
  - Moderate/severe → IV broad-spectrum (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenem, ± vancomycin if MRSA suspected)

- Drain abscesses, treat osteomyelitis (IV antibiotics ± surgical debridement)

### 4. Offloading / Pressure relief

- Essential to prevent further trauma
- Methods:

  - Total contact cast
  - Removable cast walker
  - Special shoes, crutches, wheelchair if needed

### 5. Vascular assessment and revascularization

- **Investigations**:

  - Ankle-brachial index (ABI), Doppler US, CT/MR angiography

- **Revascularization options**:

  - Endovascular: angioplasty ± stent
  - Open: bypass grafting

- Indicated if ischemia present (neuro-ischemic ulcer)

### 6. Surgical management

- **Minor amputation**: toe, ray, transmetatarsal (for localized gangrene/severe infection)
- **Major amputation**: below-knee or above-knee (if non-salvageable limb, spreading infection, life-threatening sepsis)

### 7. Multidisciplinary approach

- Diabetologist, vascular surgeon, orthopedic/foot surgeon, infectious disease specialist, podiatrist, physiotherapist

### 8. Prevention (long-term)

- Good glycemic control
- Regular podiatric care
- Protective footwear
- Early treatment of callus, minor trauma, and infection
- Patient education → never walk barefoot, daily foot check
