# Surgical Site Infection (SSI)

> Infection occurring **at or near a surgical incision** within **30 days of the operation** (or within 1 year if an implant is in place), involving skin, subcutaneous tissue, deep soft tissue, or organ/space manipulated during surgery.

## Classification

| Type                           | Site Involved                                             | Example                                     | Timing                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Superficial Incisional SSI** | Skin and subcutaneous tissue only                         | Cellulitis at wound site                    | Within 30 days                        |
| **Deep Incisional SSI**        | Deep soft tissues (fascia, muscle)                        | Wound abscess, infected hematoma            | Within 30 days (1 year if prosthetic) |
| **Organ/Space SSI**            | Any part of anatomy opened/manipulated (organs, cavities) | Intra-abdominal abscess after bowel surgery | Within 30 days (1 year if prosthetic) |

## Diagnosis

### History

- Onset of wound pain, redness, swelling after surgery
- Fever, malaise
- Discharge (serous, purulent, foul-smelling)
- History of contamination during surgery or prolonged operative time

### Physical Examination

- Local signs: Erythema, tenderness, induration, warmth, wound gaping
- Purulent or serosanguinous discharge
- Signs of deeper involvement: fluctuant swelling, fascial dehiscence
- Systemic signs: fever, tachycardia, hypotension (if severe sepsis)

### Investigations

_(Mainly to assess extent, confirm organism, and guide antibiotic therapy)_

**For Diagnosis**

- Wound swab or pus culture & sensitivity
- Gram stain (rapid organism identification)

**For Causes**

- Review operative notes: wound class (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, dirty)
- Identify perioperative breaches (asepsis, prolonged surgery, hypothermia, blood transfusion)

**For Complications**

- CBC (raised WBC count)
- CRP, procalcitonin (inflammatory markers)
- Imaging (USG or CT) for suspected deep/organ-space collection

## Management

### 1. General Principles

- **Prompt identification and drainage** of pus
- **Appropriate antibiotics** based on culture results
- **Supportive care** to optimize wound healing

### 2. Superficial Incisional SSI

- Open part of the wound if sutures present to allow drainage
- Daily wound cleaning with sterile saline or antiseptic solution
- Short course of antibiotics if cellulitis present (`flucloxacillin` or suitable alternative in penicillin allergy)
- Leave wound open to heal by secondary intention if significant infection

### 3. Deep Incisional SSI

- Admit patient
- Open entire wound for drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics initially (e.g., `piperacillin–tazobactam`) → adjust per culture
- Negative pressure wound therapy (VAC) may be used after adequate debridement
- Re-suturing only after infection fully resolved and granulation present

### 4. Organ/Space SSI

- Imaging-guided percutaneous drainage or surgical re-exploration if required
- Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes (e.g., `piperacillin–tazobactam`, `meropenem`)
- Definitive drainage of abscess or control of source (e.g., anastomotic leak repair)

### 5. Supportive Measures (All Types)

- Adequate nutrition (protein supplementation)
- Glycemic control in diabetics
- Analgesia
- Maintain normothermia and oxygenation
- Monitor for systemic sepsis — follow **Sepsis Six** bundle if indicated

### Summary Management

| SSI Type    | Local Treatment                       | Antibiotics        | Hospitalization |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Superficial | Open wound, drain pus, clean daily    | Oral if cellulitis | Not usually     |
| Deep        | Surgical drainage, debridement        | IV broad-spectrum  | Yes             |
| Organ/Space | Drain abscess (percutaneous/surgical) | IV broad-spectrum  | Yes             |
