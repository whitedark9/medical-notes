# Minimal Access Surgery (MAS)

> **Minimal Access Surgery (MAS)**: Surgical techniques performed through small incisions or natural orifices, using specialized instruments and visualization systems (e.g., laparoscope, thoracoscope, endoscope), aimed at reducing tissue trauma while achieving the same therapeutic goals as open surgery.

- Examples: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thoracoscopic sympathectomy, hysteroscopic myomectomy.

## Extent Of MAS

| Region                      | Examples                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Abdomen**                 | Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendicectomy, colectomy, hernia repair, adrenalectomy     |
| **Thorax**                  | Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lung biopsy, sympathectomy, decortication |
| **Pelvis**                  | Laparoscopic hysterectomy, oophorectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy                           |
| **Urology**                 | Laparoscopic nephrectomy, prostatectomy                                                   |
| **Orthopaedics**            | Arthroscopy for knee, shoulder, ankle                                                     |
| **ENT**                     | Endoscopic sinus surgery, stapedectomy                                                    |
| **Natural orifice surgery** | Transvaginal cholecystectomy, NOTES (Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery)     |

## Benefits Of MAS

| Benefit                          | Explanation                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Reduced postoperative pain       | Smaller incisions → less nociceptor stimulation      |
| Shorter hospital stay            | Faster recovery and mobilization                     |
| Better cosmesis                  | Small scars instead of large laparotomy scar         |
| Faster return to normal activity | Less pain and quicker rehabilitation                 |
| Lower wound complications        | Reduced risk of infection, dehiscence, hernia        |
| Magnified vision                 | Laparoscope provides close-up view, aiding precision |
| Reduced blood loss               | Better haemostasis under magnified view              |

## Limitations Of MAS

| Limitation                      | Explanation                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High cost                       | Specialized instruments, camera systems, training                      |
| Steep learning curve            | Requires training, hand–eye coordination                               |
| Limited tactile feedback        | Loss of direct tissue feel compared to open surgery                    |
| Equipment dependence            | Requires functioning insufflators, camera, light source                |
| Longer operative time initially | Especially during surgeon’s learning phase                             |
| Risk of specific complications  | Port-site hernia, CO₂ embolism, trocar injury to viscera/vessels       |
| Not suitable for all patients   | Extensive adhesions, unstable haemodynamics, large tumours             |
| Conversion to open surgery      | Sometimes necessary if visualization inadequate or complication occurs |
