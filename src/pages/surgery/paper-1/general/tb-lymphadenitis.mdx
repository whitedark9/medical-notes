# Tuberculous Cervical Lymphadenitis

## Causes Of Lateral Neck Swelling

| Cause             | Examples                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Congenital**    | Branchial cyst, cystic hygroma, thyroglossal cyst (usually midline but may present laterally if displaced) |
| **Inflammatory**  | Acute lymphadenitis (bacterial, viral), tuberculous lymphadenitis, infectious mononucleosis                |
| **Neoplastic**    | Lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma (from head & neck, thyroid, upper aerodigestive tract)                      |
| **Vascular**      | Carotid body tumour, jugular vein phlebectasia                                                             |
| **Miscellaneous** | Sarcoidosis, cat-scratch disease                                                                           |

## Aetiology

- **Causative organism:** _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (human type common; bovine type rare in developed countries)
- **Mode of infection:**

  - Hematogenous spread from a primary focus (often lungs)
  - Lymphatic spread from contiguous sites (tonsils, adenoids)
  - Direct inoculation (rare)

- **Predisposing factors:**

  - Poor nutrition
  - Immunosuppression (e.g., HIV infection)
  - Close contact with TB patients

## Pathology

- **Primary complex** in lungs or oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue → organisms spread to cervical lymph nodes.
- **Stages:**

  1. **Lymphadenitis (Stage of enlargement)** → firm, discrete, mobile nodes
  2. **Periadenitis** → surrounding tissue involvement, matted nodes
  3. **Caseation necrosis** → softening in the center
  4. **Cold abscess formation** → fluctuant swelling without warmth/redness
  5. **Sinus formation** → abscess bursts through skin, producing discharging sinus with undermined edges

- **Histology:** Granulomas with epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells, and central caseation necrosis.

## Clinical Features

### History

- Gradual onset, painless swelling in lateral neck
- Often unilateral (posterior triangle common)
- Constitutional symptoms: low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss, malaise
- History of contact with TB patient
- Possible history of previous pulmonary TB

### Physical Examination

- Early: firm, discrete, mobile lymph nodes
- Later: matted, irregular, firm-to-soft nodes
- Cold abscess: fluctuant swelling, skin normal or slightly stretched
- Sinus: discharging, pale granulation tissue, undermined skin edges
- Other findings: cervical spine tenderness (if associated vertebral TB), signs of pulmonary TB

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **FNAC:** Granulomatous inflammation with caseation; Ziehl–Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli
- **Excisional biopsy:** When FNAC inconclusive or malignancy suspected
- **Mantoux test:** Usually positive in immunocompetent individuals
- **Chest X-ray:** Look for pulmonary TB focus

### For Causes

- ESR: Elevated in active disease
- HIV testing: If risk factors present

### For Complications

- Ultrasound neck: Abscess localization
- CT scan: If deep neck space involvement suspected

## Management

### General Principles

- Treat TB systemically with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT)
- Avoid unnecessary surgical excision (risk of sinus and scarring)
- Surgery reserved for diagnosis, drainage, or resistant cases

### Medical Treatment

- **Anti-tubercular therapy (WHO regimen):**

  - Intensive phase: `isoniazid` + `rifampicin` + `pyrazinamide` + `ethambutol` for 2 months
  - Continuation phase: `isoniazid` + `rifampicin` for 4 months (total 6 months)

- Nutritional support and treatment of comorbidities

### Surgical Treatment

- **Indications:**

  - Diagnostic excisional biopsy
  - Drainage of large cold abscess
  - Excision of residual matted nodes after completion of ATT (rare)

- **Procedures:**

  - Needle aspiration of abscess
  - Limited incision and drainage (avoid wide opening to reduce sinus risk)

### Summary Management

| Step | Action                                                   |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Confirm diagnosis (FNAC ± biopsy)                        |
| 2    | Initiate standard ATT regimen                            |
| 3    | Provide supportive care (nutrition, treat comorbidities) |
| 4    | Drain abscess only if large/symptomatic                  |
| 5    | Follow-up for resolution and monitor drug compliance     |
