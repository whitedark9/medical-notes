# Gangrene

> Macroscopic death of tissue with superadded putrefaction caused by invasion of saprophytic bacteria.

- It represents necrosis of tissue progressing to decomposition.

## Causes of Gangrene

1. **Vascular causes (Ischemia)**

- Arterial obstruction → atherosclerosis, thrombosis, embolism
- Venous obstruction → strangulated hernia, volvulus, tight bandage, tourniquet
- Trauma → crush injury, laceration of vessels
- Frostbite, burns, irradiation

2. **Infective causes**

- _Clostridium perfringens_ and other anaerobes → gas gangrene
- Necrotizing fasciitis (streptococcal)
- Fournier’s gangrene (perineum, scrotum)

3. **Physical / Chemical causes**

- Extreme cold (frostbite), heat, caustic chemicals
- Ergot poisoning, vasopressor drugs (ergometrine, dopamine in excess)

4. **Miscellaneous causes**

- Diabetes mellitus (neuropathy + vasculopathy + infection)
- Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans)
- Raynaud’s disease/severe vasospasm
- Bedsores (decubitus ulcers from prolonged pressure)

## Classifications of Gangrene

### 1. Based on Clinical Appearance

- **Dry gangrene**

  - Due to arterial occlusion without infection
  - Tissue mummified, dry, black, shrunken, with line of demarcation
  - Seen in atherosclerosis, diabetes, Buerger’s disease

- **Wet gangrene**

  - Due to venous obstruction or arterial occlusion with infection
  - Tissue swollen, soft, foul-smelling, rapidly spreading
  - Seen in strangulated hernia, volvulus, diabetic foot

- **Gas gangrene**

  - Caused by _Clostridium perfringens_ and other anaerobes in devitalized tissue
  - Crepitus, foul discharge, rapid systemic toxicity
  - Typically follows trauma or surgery in contaminated wounds

### 2. Based on Cause

- **Infective gangrene**: gas gangrene, Fournier’s gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis
- **Ischemic gangrene**: arterial occlusion (atherosclerosis, embolism, thrombosis)
- **Neuropathic gangrene**: diabetic neuropathy (foot ulcers progressing to gangrene)
- **Trophic gangrene**: from prolonged pressure → bedsores

### 3. Based on Site

- Peripheral gangrene → limbs, digits
- Visceral gangrene → bowel (strangulated hernia, volvulus, mesenteric ischemia), gallbladder (emphysematous cholecystitis)

## Dry Gangrene

> Type of gangrene due to arterial occlusion without superadded infection → affected part becomes dry, shriveled, mummified, and black.

### Symptoms

- Pain (initially severe due to ischemia → later absent once necrosis complete)
- Coldness and numbness of the affected part
- Tingling or burning sensation before necrosis sets in
- Change of color: pale → dusky red → black
- Functional loss of the part

### Signs

- Affected part:

  - Cold, dry, shriveled, black, mummified appearance
  - Clear **line of demarcation** between healthy and dead tissue (appears late, usually after weeks)
  - No blebs, no foul odor (distinguishes from wet gangrene)

- Peripheral pulses absent distal to occlusion
- Loss of sensation and motor function
- Proximal arterial disease signs: intermittent claudication, rest pain, trophic changes (hair loss, brittle nails, thin skin)

### Investigations

#### For Diagnosis

- Clinical diagnosis mainly (appearance + absent pulses)

#### For Causes

- **Doppler ultrasound** → arterial flow assessment
- **CT angiography / MR angiography / Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)** → localize level of arterial occlusion
- **Blood sugar, HbA1c** → evaluate diabetes mellitus
- **Lipid profile** → atherosclerotic risk
- **Coagulation profile** → hypercoagulable states
- Autoimmune workup if vasculitis suspected

#### For Complications

- CBC → infection or anemia
- Renal function tests → in case of extensive ischemia/rhabdomyolysis

### Management

#### General Measures

- Rest and limb protection (keep warm, avoid trauma/infection)
- Analgesia for ischemic pain
- Control of risk factors → stop smoking, control diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia

#### Medical Management

- Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel)
- Vasodilators (limited role, e.g., cilostazol, prostaglandins)
- Anticoagulation (in thromboembolic disease)
- Optimize cardiovascular status

#### Definitive / Surgical Management

- **Revascularization (if viable tissue proximal to gangrene)**

  - Angioplasty ± stenting
  - Bypass grafting (femoro-popliteal, aorto-femoral, etc.)

- **Amputation**

  - Indicated when gangrene is well demarcated, extensive, or revascularization not possible
  - Done at appropriate proximal level (below-knee or above-knee depending on vascularity)

#### Adjunctive Management

- Antibiotics (if secondary infection develops, converting to wet gangrene)
- Physiotherapy & rehabilitation post-amputation

## Buerger's Disease (Thromboangiitis Obliterans)

> `Buerger's disease` is a **non-atherosclerotic, inflammatory occlusive vasculitis** affecting **small and medium arteries & veins**, mostly in **young male smokers**.

<details>
<summary>Pathophysiology</summary>

1. **Tobacco use** triggers **immune-mediated vascular inflammation**.
1. **Inflammation → thrombosis** (clot formation) → **occlusion** of arteries.
1. **Tissue ischemia** → **gangrene of fingers & toes**.
1. **Superficial thrombophlebitis** and **Raynaud's phenomenon** may occur.

</details>

### Clinical Features

- **Intermittent claudication** (pain in hands/feet with activity).
- **Rest pain in severe cases**.
- **Cold sensitivity (Raynaud's-like symptoms)**.
- **Ulcers or gangrene in fingers/toes**.
- **Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis** (red, tender veins).

### Diagnosis

- **Clinical criteria (Shionoya's Criteria)**:
  - Age < 50 years.
  - History of smoking.
  - Distal extremity ischemia (claudication, gangrene).
  - No other arterial occlusive diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis).
  - No hypercoagulable state.
- **Doppler ultrasound & Angiography**:
  - Shows **"corkscrew collaterals"** due to compensatory vessels.

### Management of Buerger's Disease

1. Smoking Cessation (Most Important)
1. **Vasodilators**: `Iloprost` (Prostacyclin analog), `Calcium channel blockers` (Nifedipine) for Raynaud's symptoms
1. **Antiplatelets** (`Aspirin`, `Clopidogrel`) to reduce clotting risk.
1. Pain & Ulcer Management
   - `Analgesics` (NSAIDs, opioids if severe).
   - **Wound care & debridement** for ulcers.
1. Amputation (For Gangrene)
