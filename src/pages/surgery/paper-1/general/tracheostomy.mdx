# Tracheostomy

> A surgical procedure creating a direct airway by making an opening in the anterior wall of the trachea and inserting a tracheostomy tube.

## Indications

## Advantages

| Advantage                                             | Explanation                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Better patient comfort                                | Compared to prolonged oral/nasal intubation |
| Improved oral hygiene                                 | Mouth and pharynx free of tubes             |
| Easier weaning from ventilator                        | Reduces dead space, airway resistance       |
| Better airway security                                | Tube less likely to be displaced than ETT   |
| Facilitates suction and airway clearance              | Large-bore tube enables deep suctioning     |
| Allows oral feeding and speech (with speaking valves) | When cuff deflated or fenestrated tube used |
| Reduces laryngeal/tracheal injury risk                | Compared to prolonged intubation            |

## Disadvantages

| Disadvantage                  | Explanation                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surgical risks                | Haemorrhage, pneumothorax, surgical emphysema, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury |
| Long-term complications       | Tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia, fistula formation                            |
| Loss of normal humidification | Bypasses upper airway → secretions become thick, crusting risk                  |
| Speech difficulty             | Unless special valves used                                                      |
| Cosmetic scar                 | May be permanent                                                                |
| Requires regular tube care    | Skilled nursing and suction equipment needed                                    |

## Post-Operative Care

1. **Airway care**

   - Ensure tube patency: frequent suctioning (sterile technique)
   - Humidified oxygen to prevent secretion crusting
   - Regular inspection for displacement or blockage

2. **Tube care**

   - Clean or change inner cannula daily
   - Secure ties to avoid accidental decannulation
   - Change whole tube as per protocol (usually every 1–2 weeks)

3. **Wound care**

   - Keep site clean and dry
   - Watch for signs of infection or bleeding

4. **Humidification and suction**

   - Continuous humidification
   - Suction as required to clear secretions

5. **Cuff management** (if cuffed tube)

   - Monitor cuff pressure (≤25 cmH₂O) to prevent tracheal mucosal damage
   - Deflate cuff intermittently if possible

6. **Communication and nutrition**

   - Speech valve assessment if patient able to tolerate
   - Swallowing evaluation before oral feeding

7. **Weaning and decannulation**

   - Gradual downsizing of tube
   - Capping trials before removal
