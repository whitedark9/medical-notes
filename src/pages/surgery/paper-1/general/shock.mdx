# Shock

> A life-threatening condition of circulatory failure leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery, resulting in cellular dysfunction and organ failure.

## Classification of Shock

1. **Hypovolemic Shock**
   - Due to decreased intravascular volume.
   - Causes: `Haemorrhage` (trauma, GI bleeding), `dehydration` (vomiting, diarrhea, burns).
1. **Cardiogenic Shock**
   - Due to pump failure of the heart.
   - Causes: `Myocardial infarction`, `myocarditis`, `arrhythmias`, `valvular disease`.
1. **Obstructive Shock**
   - Due to obstruction in the circulation.
   - Causes: `Pulmonary embolism`, `cardiac tamponade`, `tension pneumothorax`.
1. **Distributive Shock**
   - Due to vasodilation and maldistribution of blood.
   - Causes:
     - `Septic Shock`: Infection leading to systemic inflammatory response.
     - `Anaphylactic Shock`: Severe allergic reaction.
     - `Neurogenic Shock`: Spinal cord injury disrupting autonomic control.
1. **Endocrine Shock**
   - Due to severe endocrine dysfunction leading to circulatory collapse.
   - Examples:
     - `Adrenal Crisis` (Acute Adrenal Insufficiency) → Lack of cortisol → Hypotension, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance.
     - `Myxedema Coma` (Severe hypothyroidism) → Hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension.
     - `Thyroid Storm` (Severe hyperthyroidism) → Tachycardia, high-output heart failure.

## Management

### 1. Resuscitation — _ABCDEF Approach_

#### Airway (A)

- Assess for airway compromise (low GCS, impending respiratory failure) → secure airway with endotracheal intubation if needed.

#### Breathing (B)

- Administer high-flow oxygen → target SpO₂ ≥ 94% (except in COPD).
- Mechanical ventilation if respiratory distress or PaO₂ < 60 mmHg despite O₂.

#### Circulation (C)

- **IV access**: 2 large-bore cannulas (14–16G) or central line.
- **Fluid resuscitation**: 30 mL/kg isotonic crystalloids (`Ringer's lactate` or `normal saline`) within first 3 hours.
- Monitor MAP (target ≥ 65 mmHg).
- **Vasopressors**: If hypotension persists after fluids → start `norepinephrine` via central line (first-line). Add `vasopressin` or `adrenaline` if refractory.

#### Disability (D)

- Assess GCS, blood glucose (treat hypoglycaemia if < 4 mmol/L).

#### Exposure/Environment (E)

- Fully expose patient to look for signs of peritonitis, abdominal distension, surgical scars, trauma marks.
- Maintain normothermia (warm blankets, warm fluids).

#### Further Immediate Measures (F)

- **Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics** within 1 hour of recognition:

  - Perforated appendicitis & perforated duodenal ulcer: `piperacillin–tazobactam` or `meropenem` ± `metronidazole`
  - Large bowel obstruction with risk of perforation: broader Gram-negative and anaerobic cover — `meropenem` or `piperacillin–tazobactam` + `vancomycin` if MRSA risk.

- Analgesia (`fentanyl` or `morphine` cautiously, avoid NSAIDs in renal injury or perforation).
- NG tube decompression if vomiting or bowel obstruction suspected.
- Foley catheter for urine output monitoring (target ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr).

### 2. Investigations

#### For Diagnosis & Severity

- CBC (leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia)
- Renal function, electrolytes
- LFTs
- CRP, procalcitonin
- Arterial blood gases (metabolic acidosis, lactate > 2 mmol/L)
- Blood cultures (before antibiotics if possible, but don’t delay treatment)
- Cross-match blood

#### Imaging

- Erect chest X-ray: free gas under diaphragm in perforation
- Abdominal X-ray: obstruction signs (dilated loops, air-fluid levels)
- Ultrasound: intra-abdominal fluid, appendicular mass/abscess
- CT abdomen with contrast: to confirm diagnosis and guide surgical plan if stable enough

### 3. Source Control (Definitive Management)

Performed **as soon as patient is hemodynamically optimized** (ideally within 6–12 hours, but emergent in ongoing peritonitis).

- **Perforated acute appendicitis**:

  - `Emergency appendicectomy` (open or laparoscopic) ± `peritoneal lavage`.
  - Drain abscess if present.

- **Perforated duodenal ulcer**:

  - `Emergency laparotomy` with primary closure (Graham omental patch) ± `peritoneal lavage`.
  - In selected stable patients with small perforations and minimal peritonitis: laparoscopic repair.

- **Large intestinal obstruction due to recto-sigmoid tumor**:

  - `Emergency laparotomy` — resection (`Hartmann’s procedure`) or `stoma formation` (loop colostomy) depending on patient stability and contamination.
  - Decompress colon if massively distended.

### 4. Ongoing Supportive Care (Common)

- Continue IV antibiotics for 5–7 days (longer if contamination severe or residual abscess).
- Vasopressor support until stable.
- Early enteral nutrition if feasible.
- Monitor for complications:

  - Intra-abdominal abscess
  - Anastomotic leak
  - Multi-organ failure

- Step-down to ward once off vasopressors and tolerating diet.
