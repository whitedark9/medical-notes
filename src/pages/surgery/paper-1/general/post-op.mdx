1. **Fever**: Due to infection, atelectasis, thrombophlebitis, or drug reaction.
1. **Pain**: Inadequate pain control can lead to complications like atelectasis or deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
1. **Nausea & Vomiting**: Common due to anesthetic agents and opioids.
1. **Delirium**: Can be caused by hypoxia, sepsis, metabolic imbalance, or anesthesia.

## 2. Wound-Related Complications

1. **Surgical Site Infection (SSI)**: Redness, warmth, discharge from the wound.
1. **Dehiscence**: Partial or complete reopening of a surgical wound.
1. **Evisceration**: Protrusion of abdominal contents through a dehisced wound.
1. **Incisional hernia**: Protrusion of abdominal tissue through a previous surgical incision

## 3. Neurological Complications

1. **Stroke**: Increased risk in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
1. **Peripheral Nerve Injury**: Due to positioning during surgery or prolonged immobilization.

## 4. Cardiovascular Complications

1. **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** → Risk of **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**.
1. **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**: Increased risk in elderly or those with pre-existing cardiac disease.
1. **Hypotension**: Due to hypovolemia, bleeding, or anesthetic effects.
1. **Hypertension**: Can result from pain, fluid overload, or withdrawal from chronic antihypertensive therapy.

## 5. Respiratory Complications

1. **Atelectasis**: Common within 24–48 hours post-op, caused by poor ventilation.
1. **Pneumonia**: Often secondary to atelectasis or aspiration.
1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: Due to DVT; presents with sudden dyspnea and chest pain.

## 6. Gastrointestinal Complications

1. **Paralytic Ileus**: Temporary bowel paralysis leading to distension, nausea, and vomiting.
1. **Bowel Obstruction**: Can occur due to adhesions or herniation.
1. **Anastomotic Leak**: Serious complication after bowel surgery.

## 7. Genitourinary Complications

1. **Urinary Retention**: Common post-anesthesia effect, requiring catheterization.
1. **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Due to hypovolemia, nephrotoxic drugs, or sepsis.

## 8. Hematological Complications

1. **Bleeding/Hemorrhage**: Can be primary (intra-op), reactionary (within 24 hours), or secondary (after 7 days).
1. **Anemia**: Due to intraoperative or post-op blood loss.

## 9. Metabolic & Endocrine Complications

1. **Electrolyte Imbalance**: Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hypokalemia due to IV fluids or medications.
1. **Hyperglycemia/Hypoglycemia**: Especially in diabetic patients.
1. **Adrenal Insufficiency**: Can occur in steroid-dependent patients.

## 10. Psychological Complications

1. **Postoperative Depression**: Common in elderly and chronically ill patients.
1. **Postoperative Delirium**: Confusion, agitation, hallucinations, often seen in ICU patients.
