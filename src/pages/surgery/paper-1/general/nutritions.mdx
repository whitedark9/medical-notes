# Nutrition

## Types of Nutrition in Surgical Practice

### 1. Enteral Nutrition (EN)

> Nutrition delivered directly into the **gastrointestinal (GI) tract** via a tube.

#### Types of Enteral Nutrition

1. `Nasogastric (NG) Tube Feeding`: Tube from nose to stomach.
1. `Nasoduodenal/Nasojejunal (ND/NJ) Tube Feeding`: Tube from nose to small intestine.
1. `Gastrostomy (PEG/PRG)`: Tube placed into the stomach via the abdominal wall. (Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy/Percutaneous Radiograhic Gastrostomy)
1. `Jejunostomy (PEJ/PRJ)`: Tube placed into the jejunum via the abdominal wall.

### 2. Parenteral Nutrition (PN)

> Nutrients delivered directly into the **bloodstream**, bypassing the GI tract.

#### Types of Parenteral Nutrition

1. `Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition (PPN)`: Given through a **peripheral vein** (short-term, low-calorie).
1. `Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)`: Given through a **central vein** (long-term, high-calorie).

## Indications

### Indications for Enteral Nurtition

1. Functional GI tract but patient unable to eat
1. Prolonged anorexia or inadequate oral intake
1. Dysphagia (e.g., stroke, head injury)
1. Severe burns, trauma, sepsis (if gut works)
1. Postoperative nutrition (if early oral feeding not possible)

### Indications for Parenteral Nutrition

1. Malabsorption syndromes (e.g., short bowel syndrome)
1. Severe pancreatitis (with ileus)
1. Bowel obstruction
1. High-output fistulae
1. Paralytic ileus

## Complications

### 1. Enteral Nutrition Complications

#### Gastrointestinal

- **Diarrhea** → Due to high osmolarity feed or lactose intolerance.
- **Nausea/Vomiting** → Gastric retention or delayed emptying.
- **Aspiration Pneumonia** → Regurgitation leading to **lung infection**.
- **Abdominal Distension** → Intolerance to feeding.

#### Mechanical [#EN]

- **Tube Displacement** → Can lead to feeding into lungs (aspiration risk).
- **Tube Blockage** → Due to thick feeds or poor flushing.
- **Nasal/Esophageal Ulceration** → Long-term NG tube use.

#### Metabolic [#EN]

- **Refeeding Syndrome** → Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia.
- **Hyperglycemia** → Due to high glucose load.

### 2. Parenteral Nutrition Complications

#### Infectious

- **Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infections (CRBSI)** → **Most serious complication** due to central venous catheter contamination.
- **Sepsis** → Bacterial/fungal infection from **TPN line**.

### Mechanical

- **Catheter Occlusion** → Clotting in central line.
- **Pneumothorax** → During central line insertion.
- **Thrombosis** → Due to long-term catheter use.

### Metabolic

- **Hyperglycemia** → Due to high glucose content in TPN.
- **Hypoglycemia** → If TPN is stopped abruptly.
- **Electrolyte Imbalance** → Hypophosphatemia (Refeeding Syndrome).
- **Liver Dysfunction** → Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) from long-term TPN.
