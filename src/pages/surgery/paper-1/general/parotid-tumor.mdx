# Parotid Tumor

- Neoplasm arising from parotid gland (largest salivary gland).
- Can be **benign** (majority) or **malignant**.

## TYPES

### 1. **Benign Tumors (≈ 80%)**

- **Pleomorphic adenoma** (most common).
- Warthin’s tumor (adenolymphoma).
- Oncocytoma.
- Basal cell adenoma.
- Canalicular adenoma.

### 2. **Malignant Tumors (≈ 20%)**

- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (most common).
- Adenoid cystic carcinoma.
- Acinic cell carcinoma.
- Carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma.
- Adenocarcinoma, SCC, metastasis (rare).

## CLINICAL FEATURES

### Benign Tumor

- Slow-growing, painless swelling.
- Firm, mobile (except at deep lobe where mobility is limited).
- Usually no facial nerve involvement.

### Malignant Tumor

- Rapid increase in size.
- Painful swelling.
- Hard, irregular, fixed mass.
- Facial nerve palsy → strongly suggests malignancy.
- Cervical lymphadenopathy (if metastatic).
- Skin infiltration or ulceration in advanced stage.

## INVESTIGATIONS

### For Diagnosis

- **Ultrasound** → cystic vs solid, guides FNAC.
- **FNAC** → useful for cytological diagnosis (not always definitive).
- **MRI/CT** → extent, deep lobe involvement, relation to facial nerve and adjacent structures.

### For Causes (Histological typing)

- FNAC / Core needle biopsy (careful, avoid seeding).
- Excision with histopathology = gold standard.

### For Complications / Spread

- Chest X-ray or CT → pulmonary metastasis.
- PET-CT → staging in advanced cases.
- Neck USG/CT → nodal involvement.

## MANAGEMENT

### Benign Tumor

- `Superficial parotidectomy` → for tumors in superficial lobe.
- `Total conservative parotidectomy` → for deep lobe tumors.
- `Avoid enucleation` → high recurrence risk.

### Malignant Tumor

- `Total conservative parotidectomy` → if confined, facial nerve uninvolved.
- `Radical parotidectomy` → if facial nerve infiltrated.
- `Extended radical parotidectomy` → if adjacent structures invaded.
- `Neck dissection` → if nodal metastasis.
- `Post-op radiotherapy` → high-grade, recurrent, positive margin, perineural invasion.

## COMPLICATIONS OF SURGERY

- Facial nerve palsy (temporary or permanent).
- Salivary fistula.
- Frey’s syndrome (gustatory sweating).
- Hematoma, infection, recurrence.
