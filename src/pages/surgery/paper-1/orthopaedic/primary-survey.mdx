# Triage And Primary Survey In Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)

## Triage

- The process of sorting patients based on the urgency of their need for treatment, especially in situations with multiple casualties and limited resources.
- Goal: provide the greatest good for the greatest number by prioritizing treatment according to severity and survivability.

### Common triage categories in trauma

| Category      | Colour Code | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Immediate** | Red         | Life-threatening injuries but salvageable with immediate intervention |
| **Delayed**   | Yellow      | Serious but not immediately life-threatening; can wait for treatment  |
| **Minimal**   | Green       | Minor injuries; ambulatory; treatment can be delayed                  |
| **Expectant** | Black       | Injuries incompatible with life or patient already deceased           |

## Primary Survey In ATLS

The primary survey is a rapid, structured assessment to identify and immediately treat life-threatening conditions.

### A – Airway With Cervical Spine Protection

- Assess airway patency: look, listen, feel for air movement
- Clear airway if obstructed (suction, remove foreign bodies)
- Use airway adjuncts (`oropharyngeal airway`, `nasopharyngeal airway`) if needed
- Definitive airway (endotracheal intubation, surgical airway) if compromised
- Maintain cervical spine immobilization (manual in-line stabilization, rigid collar) until injury excluded

### B – Breathing And Ventilation

- Inspect chest for movement, wounds, deformity
- Palpate for tenderness, instability, crepitus
- Percuss for hyperresonance (pneumothorax) or dullness (haemothorax)
- Auscultate for breath sounds
- Immediate treatment of life-threatening thoracic injuries:

  - Tension pneumothorax → needle decompression + chest tube
  - Open pneumothorax → occlusive dressing + chest tube
  - Massive haemothorax → chest tube ± surgery
  - Flail chest with pulmonary contusion → oxygenation, ventilation support
  - Cardiac tamponade → pericardiocentesis

### C – Circulation With Haemorrhage Control

- Check pulse rate, quality, skin colour, capillary refill
- Control external haemorrhage with direct pressure, tourniquets if necessary
- Establish two large-bore IV lines or intraosseous access
- Draw blood for CBC, type & crossmatch, coagulation profile
- Begin rapid fluid resuscitation with warmed crystalloids; consider early blood products in massive haemorrhage
- Pelvic binder if unstable pelvic fracture suspected

### D – Disability (Neurological Status)

- Rapid neurological evaluation: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), pupil size and reactivity
- Check for lateralizing neurological signs
- Treat reversible causes of altered consciousness (e.g., hypoglycaemia)

### E – Exposure And Environment Control

- Fully expose patient to assess for hidden injuries
- Prevent hypothermia with warm blankets, fluid warmers, and warmed ambient temperature

### F – Adjuncts To Primary Survey

- Monitor vital signs continuously
- Perform FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) to detect intraperitoneal bleeding
- Obtain portable chest and pelvis X-rays
- ECG monitoring

### Summary Of Primary Survey

| Step             | Key Actions                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Airway & C-spine | Secure airway, clear obstructions, immobilize cervical spine |
| Breathing        | Assess and treat life-threatening chest injuries             |
| Circulation      | Control bleeding, IV/IO access, fluid/blood resuscitation    |
| Disability       | GCS, pupils, neurological assessment                         |
| Exposure         | Full exposure, prevent hypothermia                           |
| Adjuncts         | FAST, chest/pelvis X-ray, ECG monitoring                     |
