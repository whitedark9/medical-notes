# Colles' Fracture

## Definition

- Extra-articular fracture of the distal radius within 2–3 cm of the wrist joint
- Dorsal displacement and angulation of distal fragment
- Often associated with fracture of ulnar styloid

## Classification

- `Frykman` classification (based on articular involvement and ulnar fracture):

| Type          | Description                                                |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type I**    | Extra-articular radius fracture only                       |
| **Type II**   | Extra-articular radius fracture + ulnar styloid fracture   |
| **Type III**  | Intra-articular fracture involving radiocarpal joint       |
| **Type IV**   | Intra-articular fracture + ulnar styloid fracture          |
| **Type V**    | Intra-articular fracture involving distal radioulnar joint |
| **Type VI**   | As type V + ulnar styloid fracture                         |
| **Type VII**  | Both radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint involvement   |
| **Type VIII** | As type VII + ulnar styloid fracture                       |

## Clinical Features

### History

- Fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH), forearm pronated
- Common in elderly women with osteoporosis
- Pain and swelling at wrist immediately after injury

### Examination

- Deformity: "dinner fork" appearance (dorsal displacement/angulation)
- Tenderness over distal radius
- Swelling and ecchymosis around wrist
- Painful and limited wrist motion
- Assess neurovascular status (median nerve compression → paresthesia in thumb/index/middle fingers)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- X-ray wrist (AP and true lateral views):

  - Features: dorsal displacement, dorsal angulation, radial shortening, radial inclination decreased
  - Look for associated ulnar styloid fracture

### For Causes

- Bone density scan (DEXA) if osteoporosis suspected (especially postmenopausal women)

### For Complications

- Carpal tunnel syndrome: nerve conduction studies if persistent symptoms
- Repeat X-rays after reduction to ensure maintenance of position

## Management

### Immediate

- Analgesia: `paracetamol`, `ibuprofen` ± regional block/haematoma block before manipulation
- Immobilization in a below-elbow backslab if definitive management delayed
- Elevation and ice to reduce swelling

### Definitive treatment

Depends on displacement and patient factors:

1. **Undisplaced fracture**

   - Immobilize in below-elbow cast in neutral or slight flexion for 6 weeks

2. **Displaced fracture (majority)**

   - Closed reduction under local anaesthesia/haematoma block or sedation
   - Immobilize in below-elbow cast with slight palmar flexion and ulnar deviation for 6 weeks
   - Post-reduction X-ray to confirm alignment

3. **Unstable fracture** (cannot maintain reduction, comminuted, intra-articular, osteoporotic bone)

   - Percutaneous K-wire fixation, external fixation, or volar locking plate ORIF

### Rehabilitation

- Early finger and shoulder movement to prevent stiffness
- Gentle wrist mobilization after cast removal
- Physiotherapy if needed

## Complications To Monitor

- Early: median nerve injury (acute carpal tunnel), compartment syndrome, skin pressure sores
- Late: malunion (dinner fork deformity), stiffness, chronic pain, post-traumatic arthritis, tendon rupture (extensor pollicis longus), complex regional pain syndrome

### Summary Management

> Always assess and monitor neurovascular status.

| Fracture                      | Management                                 |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Undisplaced                   | cast 6 weeks                               |
| Displaced stable              | closed reduction + cast                    |
| Displaced unstable/comminuted | fixation (K-wire, plate, external fixator) |
