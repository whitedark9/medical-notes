# Osteomyelitis

> Infection of bone and marrow spaces by microorganisms (usually pyogenic bacteria) → inflammation, ischemic necrosis (sequestrum), and new bone formation (involucrum).

## Classification

- By time course: acute (\<2 wks), subacute (2–6 wks; e.g., Brodie’s abscess), chronic (>6 wks, sequestrum/involucrum/sinus)
- By route: haematogenous (children), contiguous focus (post-trauma/surgery), vascular insufficiency–associated (diabetes)
- By anatomic–physiologic (Cierny–Mader): I medullary, II superficial, III localized cortical, IV diffuse; host A/B/C (normal/compromised/poor surgical candidate)

## Pathophysiology of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in children

- Transient bacteraemia (skin/resp tract) → organisms reach metaphyseal “hairpin” capillary loops with sluggish flow
- Adhesion to bone matrix (MSCRAMMs) → microabscess formation
- Neutrophil influx → pus accumulation → ↑ intramedullary pressure
- Venous thrombosis of metaphyseal sinusoids → ischemia → necrotic bone (sequestrum)
- Pus tracks via Haversian/Volkmann canals → lifts loose periosteum in children → subperiosteal abscess
- Periosteal osteogenesis → involucrum
- Spread to joint:

  - infants: transphyseal vessels allow epiphyseal/joint seeding
  - older children: physis is a barrier; but metaphysis is intracapsular at hip/shoulder/ankle → septic arthritis possible

- Systemic effects → fever, toxaemia; local effects → pain, pseudoparalysis, refusal to bear weight

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- FBC, CRP, ESR → inflammatory markers (CRP rises early; useful for response tracking)
- Two sets of blood cultures before antibiotics (do not delay therapy if septic)
- Plain X-ray femur (AP/lat) including hip and knee → often normal in first 7–10 days; later: periosteal reaction, lytic areas
- Ultrasound thigh/hip → periosteal elevation/subperiosteal or intramuscular collection; hip effusion (exclude septic arthritis)
- MRI with contrast (preferred) → early marrow oedema within 24–48 h; delineates abscess, physis, and soft-tissue extent

  - alternative if MRI unavailable: technetium bone scan (sensitive, less specific)

- Diagnostic aspiration (US-guided) of collection/joint if present → Gram stain, culture, sensitivities

### For Causes

- Usual at age 6: _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA/MRSA), _Streptococcus pyogenes_; _Kingella kingae_ (mainly \<5 y but possible); _Salmonella spp._ if sickle cell
- Tests: culture from blood/aspirate; sickle cell screen if indicated; consider immunodeficiency work-up if recurrent/unusual organisms

### For Complications

- Serial CRP every 48–72 h → response; ESR weekly
- Repeat US/MRI if persistent fever/pain ≥48–72 h → look for subperiosteal/intramedullary abscess or septic arthritis
- Follow-up X-rays at 2–3 and 6–8 weeks → periosteal reaction/healing; later for growth arrest/angulation
- Consider Doppler if limb swelling disproportionate (DVT rare but possible)

### Differentals to actively exclude

- Septic arthritis of hip/knee → US effusion; urgent joint aspiration if effusion + severe pain/pseudoparalysis
- Cellulitis/pyomyositis → MRI distinguishes soft-tissue predominant disease
- Malignancy (Ewing sarcoma/leukaemia) → atypical imaging; peripheral smear if red flags (pallor, bruising, weight loss)
- Stress/traumatic fracture → history; MRI pattern

## Management

### Initial (on admission)

- Admit; analgesia, IV access, fluids if needed; immobilize limb (above-knee backslab/Thomas splint) for comfort
- Empiric IV antibiotics immediately after cultures (earlier if septic), tailor to local antibiogram:

  - MSSA likely, low MRSA: cefazolin 50 mg/kg IV q8h or cloxacillin/nafcillin 50 mg/kg IV q6h
  - MRSA risk/high prevalence: vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q6h (AUC-guided) or clindamycin 10–13 mg/kg IV q8h (if local clindamycin-susceptible)
  - Sickle-cell/Gram-negative concern: add ceftriaxone 50–75 mg/kg IV daily (or cefotaxime)

- Modify promptly to culture/sensitivity results

### Indications For Surgery

- Subperiosteal/intramedullary abscess on imaging
- Failure to improve clinically/biochemically after 24–48 h of appropriate antibiotics
- Septic arthritis of adjacent joint (hip/knee) → urgent arthrotomy/irrigation within hours
- Compartment syndrome (rare) → emergent fasciotomy

### Surgical Options

- Incision and drainage of abscess; limited cortical window/medullary decompression (“trephination”) avoiding physis
- Copious irrigation; multiple deep samples for microbiology ± histology
- Drain placement ± negative-pressure wound therapy if extensive soft tissue involvement

### Antibiotic

- IV until afebrile, pain improved, and CRP falling (typically 3–5 days) → switch to appropriate oral agent
- Total duration 4–6 weeks (uncomplicated); extend if abscess/sequestrum/chronicity
- Examples for step-down (culture-guided): `flucloxacillin`/`cephalexin` (MSSA); `clindamycin`/`linezolid` (MRSA, per susceptibilities); `amoxicillin-clavulanate` if polymicrobial

### Supportive and Follow-up

- Elevation, gentle ROM of adjacent joints as pain allows; physiotherapy after acute phase
- Monitor clinical status and CRP every 2–3 days initially, then weekly; ESR may lag
- Educate on red flags for relapse (rebound fever, increasing pain)
- Long-term: monitor limb length/axis (growth plate risk), especially with metaphyseal involvement

### Potential Complications

- Septic arthritis (hip/knee), pathological fracture, growth disturbance (LLD/angulation), chronic osteomyelitis (sequestrum/sinus), recurrence
