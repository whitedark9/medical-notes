# Fracture Neck of Femur (NOF)

> Fracture of the **femoral neck** (between the femoral head and intertrochanteric line) is a common injury, especially in elderly due to osteoporosis.

## Classification of Fracture Neck of Femur

### 1. Anatomical Classification

- **Subcapital**: just below femoral head
- **Transcervical**: through the mid-neck
- **Basicervical**: at the base of neck

### 2. Garden Classification _(Most commonly used clinically)_

Describes **displacement and stability**, important for management:

| Garden Type | Description                         | Stability |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | --------- |
| I           | Incomplete/valgus impacted fracture | Stable    |
| II          | Complete but non-displaced          | Stable    |
| III         | Complete, partially displaced       | Unstable  |
| IV          | Complete, fully displaced           | Unstable  |

### 3. Pauwel’s Classification

Based on **angle of fracture line** with the horizontal on AP X-ray. Predicts **shear force and non-union risk**:

| Pauwel's Type | Angle  | Stability         |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| I             | < 30°  | Most stable       |
| II            | 30–50° | Moderately stable |
| III           | > 50°  | Least stable      |

## Management

### Initial Evaluation

- **History**: Fall, sudden hip pain, inability to bear weight
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Shortened, externally rotated leg
  - Tenderness over groin/hip
  - Limited active/passive ROM

### Investigations

#### Laboratory:

- CBC, renal function, coagulation profile, cross-match
- Vitamin D, calcium (if metabolic bone disease suspected)

#### Imaging:

- **X-ray pelvis with both hips (AP + lateral)**
- **MRI**: if X-ray is normal but fracture is suspected (occult fracture)
- **CT scan**: for pre-op planning if complex fracture

## Definitive Management

### A. Non-Surgical (Rarely used)

- Indications:
  - Non-displaced (Garden I–II)
  - Medically unfit for surgery
- Methods:
  - Bed rest and traction (rare now)
  - Mobilization with physiotherapy
- Risk: high rates of **non-union** and **AVN (avascular necrosis)**

### B. Surgical Management

#### Indications for Surgery

- All displaced fractures
- Most non-displaced fractures (for faster mobilization)
- To prevent AVN and non-union

#### Choice of Procedure Based on Age and Fracture Type

| Age/Functional Status | Fracture Type | Surgery                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| < 60 yrs              | Garden I–II   | Internal fixation (cannulated screws or DHS) |
| < 60 yrs              | Garden III–IV | ORIF or valgus osteotomy (if viable)         |
| > 60 yrs or poor bone | Garden III–IV | Arthroplasty                                 |

#### Types of Surgical Options

1. **Internal Fixation**
   - **Cannulated Cancellous Screws**: for non-displaced, younger patients
   - **Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS)**: more stable fixation in basicervical or vertical fractures
2. **Hemiarthroplasty**: replace femoral head
   - Indications:
     - Elderly
     - Garden III–IV
     - Non-viable femoral head
   - Types: `Unipolar` (Austin Moore) or `Bipolar`
3. **Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)**
   - Indications:
     - Elderly, active
     - Pre-existing arthritis
     - Better long-term mobility

#### Preoperative Preparation

- Optimize comorbidities
- DVT prophylaxis
- Fluid/electrolyte correction

#### Postoperative Care

- Early mobilization with physiotherapy
- Thromboprophylaxis
- Pain management

## Complications

| Early                      | Late                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| DVT/PE                     | Avascular necrosis (AVN)\*          |
| Infection                  | Non-union or malunion               |
| Delirium (elderly)         | Implant failure or loosening        |
| Dislocation (arthroplasty) | Osteoarthritis (if joint preserved) |

\*AVN = death of bone tissue due to disrupted blood supply

## Prevention

- Osteoporosis management (`vitamin D`, `calcium`, `bisphosphonates`)
- Fall prevention
- Hip protectors in high-risk elderly

## Prognosis

- Depends on:
  - Age
  - Delay to surgery
  - Type of fracture
  - Post-op mobility
- Mortality: up to 30% at 1 year in elderly
