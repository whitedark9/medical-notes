# Open Fracture (Compound Fracture)

> **A fracture with direct communication between the fracture site and the external environment** through a break in the skin and soft tissue.

- Results in contamination of the fracture hematoma with bacteria → increases risk of infection, non-union, and soft tissue complications.

## Classification

### 1. Gustilo-Anderson Classification

- **Type I**

  - Wound \<1 cm, clean, minimal soft tissue damage.
  - Usually caused by low-energy trauma.

- **Type II**

  - Wound >1 cm, moderate soft tissue damage, no extensive crushing.
  - Moderate contamination.

- **Type III** (High-energy injuries, extensive soft tissue damage, high contamination)

  - **III A:** Adequate soft tissue coverage despite extensive damage.
  - **III B:** Extensive soft tissue loss, periosteal stripping, bone exposure, usually needs flap coverage.
  - **III C:** Any open fracture with arterial injury requiring repair.

## Management

### A. Emergency Approach – ABCDEF

1. **A – Airway**: Ensure patency (C-spine control if suspected injury).
2. **B – Breathing**: Assess oxygenation, ventilation.
3. **C – Circulation**: Control hemorrhage (direct pressure, avoid blind clamping).
4. **D – Disability**: Neuro status, limb function.
5. **E – Exposure & Environment**: Fully expose injury, prevent hypothermia.
6. **F – Fracture Care Priority**: Limb stabilization, prevent further contamination.

### B. Initial Management (Limb & Wound Specific)

- **Remove gross contamination** (mud, debris) without vigorous scrubbing.
- **Cover wound with sterile saline-soaked dressing**.
- **Splint the limb** in the position found to reduce pain and further damage.
- **Do not close the wound** primarily unless small, clean, and low-energy (Type I).

### C. Definitive Management

#### 1. Resuscitation & Antibiotics

- IV broad-spectrum antibiotics **as early as possible** (ideally \<3 hrs from injury):

  - **Type I & II:** 1st gen cephalosporin (e.g., cefazolin).
  - **Type III:** Add aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin).
  - Add metronidazole if farm injury/soil contamination.

- Tetanus prophylaxis according to immunization status.

#### 2. Surgical Debridement

- Goal: remove all devitalized tissue & contaminants → reduce infection risk.
- **Timing:** Traditionally within 6 hours, but Bailey & Love notes priority is early antibiotics; urgent debridement within a safe operative window.
- Repeat debridement if needed (damage control orthopaedics).

#### 3. Fracture Stabilization

- **External fixation** preferred for severe contamination/high-energy injury (Type III).
- **Internal fixation** possible in Type I–II with clean wounds after debridement.
- **Definitive fixation** delayed in high-grade open fractures until infection risk reduced.

#### 4. Soft Tissue Coverage

- Early wound closure for Type I–II after debridement.
- Delayed primary closure or flap coverage for Type III, especially IIIB.
- Orthoplastic team involvement for complex cases.

### D. Monitoring & Complication Prevention

- Watch for **compartment syndrome**.
- Monitor for **infection signs** (erythema, swelling, discharge).
- Nutritional optimization for healing.

### E. Complications

- Early: infection, hemorrhage, neurovascular injury, compartment syndrome.
- Late: non-union, malunion, chronic osteomyelitis, joint stiffness, amputation (severe cases).

## Extra Management for Tibia Open Fracture

### 1. Limb Perfusion & Compartment Pressure

- **Check distal pulses** and **capillary refill** immediately.
- Doppler if pulses weak.
- **Monitor closely for compartment syndrome** (especially in high-energy crush injuries).

  - If present → urgent fasciotomy.

### 2. Wound Care

- Large, irregular wounds over tibia may need **early orthoplastic input**.
- **Avoid tight dressing or circumferential bandaging** → can worsen compartment pressure.

### 3. Surgical Priorities for Tibia

- **Urgent irrigation & debridement** — especially important due to thin soft tissue cover.
- **Fracture Stabilization Choice**:

  - **External fixation** often preferred for severe soft tissue injury (Type III).
  - **Intramedullary nailing** for clean Type I–II fractures with adequate coverage.
  - Avoid plates in heavily contaminated wounds.

### 4. Soft Tissue Coverage

- Early coverage is **critical** — Bailey & Love notes tibia tolerates **≤72 hours** of bone exposure before infection risk skyrockets.
- For **Type III B** → plan flap coverage (muscle or fasciocutaneous) early, ideally in **first 72 hrs**.
- Work with **orthoplastic team** for flap selection (gastrocnemius or soleus flaps common).

### 5. Antibiotic Protocol Adjustments

- Broader coverage for tibia in Type III (often high-energy):

  - **Cefazolin + Gentamicin** immediately.
  - Add **Metronidazole** if farm injury or anaerobic contamination.

### 6. Rehabilitation

- **Early joint mobilization** to prevent stiffness (especially knee & ankle).
- Partial → full weight-bearing progression based on stability and healing.
- Tibia prone to delayed union → monitor fracture healing closely with serial X-rays.

### 7. Complication Vigilance

- **Delayed union & non-union** (common in tibia due to poor vascularity).
- **Chronic osteomyelitis** (higher than most long bones).
- **Compartment syndrome** (especially if combined fibula fracture).
