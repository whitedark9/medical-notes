# Management Of Patient With Polytrauma

> Polytrauma is the presence of multiple traumatic injuries involving at least two different body regions, one or more being life-threatening and requiring urgent intervention.

## Initial Approach – ABCDEF Of Trauma Care

(According to ATLS principles)

### A – Airway With Cervical Spine Protection

- Assess airway patency; if obstructed, open airway using jaw thrust/chin lift (avoid head tilt if C-spine injury suspected)
- Provide airway adjuncts (`oropharyngeal airway`, `nasopharyngeal airway`)
- Definitive airway if GCS ≤ 8 or airway compromised → endotracheal intubation with in-line cervical stabilization
- Maintain cervical collar until C-spine injury excluded clinically and radiologically

### B – Breathing And Ventilation

- Inspect, palpate, percuss, and auscultate chest
- Identify and treat immediately life-threatening thoracic injuries (tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive haemothorax, flail chest, cardiac tamponade)
- Administer high-flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask or assisted ventilation if necessary

### C – Circulation With Haemorrhage Control

- Control external bleeding with direct pressure, pressure dressings, tourniquets if needed
- Establish two large-bore IV lines (14–16G) or intraosseous access if IV fails
- Blood samples: CBC, type & crossmatch, coagulation, electrolytes, ABG
- Initiate fluid resuscitation with warmed crystalloids; consider balanced transfusion (PRBC, plasma, platelets) if massive haemorrhage suspected
- Pelvic binder if unstable pelvic fracture suspected

### D – Disability (Neurological Status)

- Rapid assessment: GCS, pupillary size and reaction
- Check for lateralizing signs or spinal cord injury signs
- Treat hypoglycaemia if present

### E – Exposure And Environment Control

- Fully expose patient to assess for hidden injuries
- Prevent hypothermia: warm blankets, fluid warmers, warmed ambient temperature

### F – Adjuncts To Primary Survey

- FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma) for intra-abdominal bleeding
- Portable chest and pelvis X-rays
- ECG monitoring

## Secondary Survey

- Full head-to-toe examination once the patient is stabilized
- Detailed history (AMPLE: Allergies, Medications, Past history, Last meal, Events leading to injury)
- Identify less urgent injuries (orthopaedic, soft tissue, minor head injuries)
- Order further investigations as indicated: CT scan (head/neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis), limb X-rays, spine imaging

## Definitive Care

- Prioritize treatment according to injury severity and patient stability
- Examples:

  - Emergency laparotomy for uncontrolled intra-abdominal bleeding
  - Chest tube for pneumothorax/haemothorax
  - External fixation for long bone fractures in damage control orthopaedics
  - Neurosurgical intervention for intracranial haematoma

- Early involvement of multidisciplinary trauma team (surgery, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, anaesthesia, radiology, ICU)

## Damage Control Surgery Principles

- Control bleeding and contamination first (temporary measures)
- Delay definitive repair until patient is physiologically stable (normothermia, correction of coagulopathy and acidosis)
- Use staged approach:

  1. Initial abbreviated surgery
  2. ICU resuscitation and stabilization
  3. Definitive surgery after recovery
