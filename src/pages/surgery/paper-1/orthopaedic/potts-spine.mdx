# Potts' Spine

## Definition

- Tuberculous infection of the vertebral column, most commonly affecting the thoracolumbar region
- Caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ via haematogenous spread from a primary focus (usually lungs)
- Leads to vertebral body destruction, collapse, kyphotic deformity, and possible spinal cord compression

## Clinical Features

### History

- Gradual onset of back pain and stiffness
- Low-grade evening fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue
- Neurological symptoms (if spinal cord compression): paresthesia, weakness, bladder/bowel involvement

### Examination

- Localized spinal tenderness and paravertebral muscle spasm
- Deformity: kyphosis/gibbus (late)
- Neurological signs of compression:

  - Motor weakness (lower limbs in thoracic lesions)
  - Sensory level
  - Hyperreflexia, spasticity below lesion

- Cold abscesses:

  - Cervical: retropharyngeal swelling
  - Thoracic: paravertebral swelling
  - Lumbar: psoas abscess (palpable in groin)

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- X-ray spine (AP and lateral views):

  - Early: loss of definition of vertebral end plates, reduction of disc space
  - Late: anterior wedging/collapse, paravertebral shadows (abscess)

- MRI spine: most sensitive for early marrow changes, epidural abscess, cord compression
- CT scan: detailed bone destruction
- ESR and CRP: elevated in active disease
- Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux): positive in most cases
- GeneXpert MTB/RIF or culture (from abscess aspirate or biopsy) for definitive diagnosis

### For Causes

- Chest X-ray: look for pulmonary TB
- HIV test: immunosuppression risk factor

### For Complications

- MRI/CT for evaluation of spinal cord compression
- Neurological examination for early detection of deficits

## Procedures

- CT-guided or ultrasound-guided aspiration of paravertebral/psoas abscess for microbiology (AFB stain, culture, GeneXpert)
- Percutaneous vertebral biopsy if diagnosis uncertain
- Surgical decompression (laminectomy/corpectomy) if severe cord compression or large abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage

## Management

### Medical

- Anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) for minimum 9–12 months:

  - Intensive phase (2 months): `isoniazid` + `rifampicin` + `pyrazinamide` + `ethambutol`
  - Continuation phase (7–10 months): `isoniazid` + `rifampicin`

- Analgesia: `paracetamol`, `NSAIDs` if no contraindication
- Bed rest in acute painful stage; gradual mobilization with spinal brace

### Surgical

#### Indications

- Progressive neurological deficit despite adequate ATT
- Severe spinal cord compression on imaging
- Large cold abscess causing pressure symptoms
- Progressive kyphotic deformity
- Instability due to extensive vertebral destruction
- Diagnostic uncertainty (need biopsy)

#### Surgical Options

- Anterior decompression and fusion (preferred in thoracic/lumbar disease)
- Posterior stabilization if instability present
- Abscess drainage (open or percutaneous)
