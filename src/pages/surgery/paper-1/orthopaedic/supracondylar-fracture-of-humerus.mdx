# Supracondylar Fracture of Humerus

> A supracondylar fracture occurs through the thin part of the distal humerus above the level of the growth plate.

## Investigations

### For Diagnosis

- **X-ray of elbow** – AP and true lateral views (including distal humerus and proximal forearm).

  - Look for fracture line, displacement, and fat pad signs (occult fracture).
  - Classify (Gartland classification):

    - **Type I:** Undisplaced
    - **Type II:** Displaced with intact posterior cortex
    - **Type III:** Completely displaced.

### For Associated Injuries / Causes

- **Neurovascular assessment** before and after manipulation:

  - **Vascular:** Palpate radial pulse, assess capillary refill, hand temperature.
  - **Neurological:** Check median nerve (especially anterior interosseous), radial nerve, and ulnar nerve functions.

- **X-ray of forearm & wrist** if suspicion of associated fractures (e.g., “floating elbow”).

### For Complications

- **Compartment pressure monitoring** if severe swelling or tight forearm.
- **Doppler/CT angiography** if vascular injury suspected and pulse not restored after gentle reduction.

## Management

### A. Emergency Principles – ABCDEF

1. **Airway** – Ensure patency.
2. **Breathing** – Oxygen if needed.
3. **Circulation** – Assess and stabilize, control any bleeding.
4. **Disability** – Limb neurovascular check.
5. **Exposure** – Expose limb, but prevent hypothermia.
6. **Fracture care** – Splint in position found, avoid excessive manipulation pre-op.

### B. Immediate Actions

- **Immobilize limb** in an above-elbow backslab at \~30° flexion if vascular compromise suspected (too much flexion may worsen perfusion).
- **Elevate limb** to reduce swelling.
- Give **analgesia** and **ice** if available.

### C. Definitive Management

(Depends on displacement & vascular status)

#### 1. Type I (Undisplaced)

- Immobilize in above-elbow backslab at 90° flexion for 3 weeks.
- Neurovascular checks regularly.

#### 2. Type II & III (Displaced)

**If vascular status normal:**

- **Urgent closed reduction & percutaneous K-wire fixation** under GA (most accepted method).
- Immobilize with elbow in \~90° flexion (avoid >120° to prevent compartment syndrome).

**If vascular compromise (cool, pale hand)**:

- **Urgent closed reduction** (may restore brachial artery flow if kinked over fracture).
- If circulation not restored immediately → urgent exploration & possible vascular repair by orthopaedic + vascular surgery team.
- Do **not** keep elbow in hyperflexion to maintain pulse → instead stabilize with minimal flexion and proceed to surgical fixation.

### D. Postoperative / Post-reduction Care

- Monitor neurovascular status **hourly for first 24 hrs**.
- Watch for **compartment syndrome** (pain out of proportion, pain on passive stretch, tense swelling).
- X-ray to confirm reduction.

### E. Complication Prevention

- Avoid repeated forceful manipulations → increases swelling and risk of compartment syndrome.
- Early recognition and treatment of:

  - Vascular injury → limb ischemia, Volkmann’s contracture.
  - Nerve injury (often neuropraxia → recovers spontaneously).
  - Cubitus varus deformity from malunion.

| Gartland Type | Vascular Status | Management                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I             | Normal          | Backslab 3 weeks                                              |
| II            | Normal          | Closed reduction + K-wire fixation                            |
| III           | Normal          | Closed reduction + K-wire fixation                            |
| Any type      | Compromised     | Urgent gentle reduction → if still pale, vascular exploration |
