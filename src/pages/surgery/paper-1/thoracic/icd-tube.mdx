# Intercostal Drainage Tube Insertion

> **Intercostal drainage (ICD)**: Placement of a chest tube into the pleural space to evacuate air, blood, pus, or other fluid.

- Purpose: **Re-expand lung**, restore negative pleural pressure, relieve respiratory distress.

## Indications

### 1. Pneumothorax

- **Tension pneumothorax** (after needle decompression)
- Large **spontaneous pneumothorax** with symptoms
- **Traumatic pneumothorax** (open or closed)
- Recurrent or persistent pneumothorax

### 2. Haemothorax

- **Massive haemothorax** (>1500 mL initial drainage)
- Moderate haemothorax causing respiratory compromise
- Ongoing bleeding (>200 mL/hour for 2â€“4 hours)

### 3. Haemopneumothorax

- Combination of blood and air in pleural space, especially post-trauma

### 4. Pleural Effusion

- Symptomatic **massive effusion** causing respiratory distress
- **Empyema thoracis** (pus in pleural space)
- Malignant pleural effusion needing drainage

### 5. Postoperative / Iatrogenic Causes

- Following thoracic surgery (lung resection, cardiac surgery)
- Following oesophageal surgery
- After certain procedures with high risk of pneumothorax (e.g., subclavian line insertion, lung biopsy)

### 6. Chylothorax

- Drainage of **chyle** to relieve symptoms and prevent respiratory compromise
