# Flail Chest

> Segment of the thoracic cage detached from the rest of the chest wall due to **≥2 fractures in ≥2 consecutive ribs**, causing **paradoxical movement** of the flail segment during respiration.

- Often associated with **pulmonary contusion**

## Clinical Features

- Paradoxical movement of flail segment: inward on inspiration, outward on expiration
- Severe chest pain and tenderness over fracture sites
- Respiratory distress and hypoxia
- Crepitus over fractured ribs
- Associated injuries common: pneumothorax, haemothorax, pulmonary contusion

## Diagnosis

### Clinical

- Observation of **paradoxical chest wall movement**
- Palpation: tenderness and crepitus over fractured ribs
- Signs of respiratory compromise: tachypnea, cyanosis, use of accessory muscles

### Radiological

- **Chest X-ray**:

  - Multiple rib fractures, flail segment
  - Associated pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, haemothorax

- **CT scan thorax**:

  - More sensitive to detect rib fractures, flail segment, pulmonary contusions
  - Evaluates associated injuries (mediastinal, pleural)

## Complications

- **Respiratory failure**: due to paradoxical movement and pulmonary contusion
- **Pneumothorax or haemothorax**
- **Atelectasis and pneumonia**
- **ARDS** (especially in severe pulmonary contusion)
- **Chronic pain or chest wall deformity**

## Management

### Initial / Supportive

- **Oxygen therapy**: maintain saturation >94%
- **Analgesia**:

  - `paracetamol` or `NSAIDs` for mild-moderate pain
  - `opioids` for severe pain
  - Regional techniques: **thoracic epidural**, **intercostal nerve block**

- **Monitoring**: continuous SpO₂, vital signs, respiratory effort

### Respiratory Support

- Mild: incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercises, physiotherapy
- Severe / respiratory compromise:

  - Non-invasive ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) if cooperative
  - Mechanical ventilation with **positive pressure ventilation** to stabilize flail segment

- Early physiotherapy to prevent atelectasis

### Surgical / Definitive

- Rarely indicated unless:

  - Persistent instability
  - Severe pain uncontrolled by analgesia
  - Non-union or chest wall deformity

- **Rib fixation (open reduction internal fixation)** in selected cases

### Treatment of Associated Injuries

- Chest tube insertion for pneumothorax or haemothorax
- Management of pulmonary contusion: supportive ventilation, fluid balance

| Step                | Key Actions                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analgesia           | `paracetamol`, `NSAIDs`, `opioids`, epidural or intercostal block     |
| Oxygen              | Maintain SpO₂ >94%, monitor respiratory rate                          |
| Respiratory Support | Incentive spirometry, physiotherapy, mechanical ventilation if severe |
| Monitoring          | Continuous SpO₂, vital signs, blood gases if ventilated               |
| Surgical            | Rib fixation in selected severe cases                                 |
| Associated Injuries | Chest tube for pneumothorax/haemothorax, manage pulmonary contusion   |
