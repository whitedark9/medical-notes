# Tension Pneumothorax

> Life-threatening accumulation of air in the pleural space under pressure → **lung collapse, mediastinal shift, and impaired venous return**, causing **circulatory and respiratory compromise**.

## Clinical Features

| Feature            | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Respiratory**    | Severe dyspnoea, tachypnea, cyanosis                                                                      |
| **Cardiovascular** | Hypotension, tachycardia, shock                                                                           |
| **Inspection**     | Distended neck veins, tracheal deviation away from affected side (late sign), asymmetrical chest movement |
| **Palpation**      | Hyperresonance on affected side, reduced chest expansion                                                  |
| **Auscultation**   | Absent or markedly reduced breath sounds on affected side                                                 |
| **Others**         | Anxiety, agitation, diaphoresis                                                                           |

## Diagnosis

> Clinically

- **Chest X-ray (if patient stable)**:

  - Visible pleural air
  - Lung collapse
  - Mediastinal shift away from affected side

- **Ultrasound / FAST scan**: can detect absence of lung sliding (useful in unstable patients)
- **ABG**: shows hypoxia and possible respiratory acidosis

## Management

### Immediate / Emergency

1. **Needle Decompression**

   - Large-bore needle (`14–16G`) into **2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line**, above the rib
   - Listen for rush of air and improvement in vital signs

2. **Definitive Chest Tube Insertion (Tube Thoracostomy)**

   - Insert in **5th intercostal space, anterior or mid-axillary line**
   - Connect to underwater seal or suction
   - Ensure lung re-expansion and continuous drainage

### Supportive Measures

- High-flow oxygen
- Analgesia (`paracetamol`, `NSAIDs`, or `opioids` if needed)
- Monitor vital signs and SpO₂ continuously
- Treat underlying cause (trauma, iatrogenic, spontaneous)

### Summary

| Step                  | Key Actions                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diagnosis             | Clinical; do not delay for imaging if unstable          |
| Emergency Management  | Needle decompression (2nd ICS, midclavicular)           |
| Definitive Management | Chest tube insertion (5th ICS, mid-axillary)            |
| Supportive Care       | Oxygen, analgesia, monitoring, address underlying cause |
