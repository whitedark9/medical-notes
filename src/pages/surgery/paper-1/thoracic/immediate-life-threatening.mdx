# Immediate Life-Threatening Conditions Of Chest Injury

> These are chest injuries that can rapidly cause death if not recognized and treated during the **primary survey** of ATLS. They must be managed **immediately on diagnosis**.

## 1. Airway Obstruction

- Cause: blood, vomitus, foreign body, facial trauma

### Clinical features [#AO]

- Stridor, hoarseness, gurgling

### Immediate management [#AO]

- Suction, airway positioning
- Intubation or surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy)

## 2. Tension Pneumothorax

> Accumulation of air under pressure in the pleural space → lung collapse + mediastinal shift → impaired venous return and cardiac output.

### Clinical features [#TP]

- Severe respiratory distress
- Unilateral absent breath sounds
- Hyperresonant percussion note on affected side
- Distended neck veins (unless hypovolaemic)
- Tracheal deviation away from affected side (late sign)
- Hypotension, tachycardia

### Immediate management [#TP]

- Needle decompression (2nd intercostal space, midclavicular line)
- Definitive chest tube insertion (5th intercostal space, anterior/mid-axillary line)

## 3. Open Pneumothorax (“Sucking Chest Wound”)

> Large defect in chest wall → air enters pleural space directly through wound during inspiration.

### Clinical features [#OP]

- Obvious open chest wound
- Sucking/whistling sound during breathing
- Respiratory distress
- Reduced breath sounds on affected side

### Immediate management [#OP]

- Seal with **occlusive dressing** taped on **three sides** (prevents air entry but allows escape)
- Chest tube insertion away from wound
- Definitive surgical closure

## 4. Massive Haemothorax

> Accumulation of >1500 mL blood in pleural space or >1/3 patient’s blood volume.

### Clinical features [#MH]

- Hypovolaemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension)
- Absent breath sounds
- Dull percussion note
- Trachea central (unless tension physiology develops)

### Immediate management [#MH]

- Large-bore chest tube insertion (usually drains >1500 mL immediately)
- Rapid fluid and blood resuscitation
- Surgical exploration if ongoing bleeding >200 mL/hour for 2–4 hours

## 5. Flail Chest With Pulmonary Contusion

> Segment of chest wall detached due to ≥2 fractures in ≥2 adjacent ribs → paradoxical movement during respiration.

### Clinical features [#FC]

- Paradoxical movement of flail segment
- Respiratory distress, hypoxia
- Crepitus over rib fractures
- Associated pulmonary contusion (alveolar damage and bleeding)

### Immediate management [#FC]

- Oxygen therapy
- Analgesia (`opioids`, regional nerve block)
- Stabilization of flail segment (external splinting or positive pressure ventilation)
- Treat underlying pulmonary contusion with supportive ventilation

## 6. Cardiac Tamponade

> Blood accumulation in pericardial sac → impaired ventricular filling → obstructive shock.

### Clinical features (Beck’s triad):

- Hypotension
- Muffled heart sounds
- Distended neck veins
- Pulsus paradoxus, tachycardia

### Immediate management [#CT]

- Pericardiocentesis (emergency)
- Definitive surgical pericardial decompression and repair of injury

## Potentially Life-Threatening Injuries

> Detected in _secondary survey[^2]_ or imaging!

7. **Myocardial Contusion**
   - Blunt trauma → bruising of heart muscle
   - Signs: arrhythmias, chest pain, ECG changes (like MI)
   - Management: cardiac monitoring, supportive care
8. **Aortic Injury (Traumatic Aortic Rupture)**
   - Deceleration injury (e.g. high-speed MVC) → tear at isthmus of aorta
   - Signs: chest pain, widened mediastinum on CXR
   - Management: CT angiography → **endovascular repair or open surgery**
9. **Tracheobronchial Injury**
   - Blunt/penetrating trauma → airway disruption
   - Signs: subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, air leak despite chest tube
   - Management: bronchoscopy → surgical repair
10. **Esophageal Injury**
    - Rare but serious; may occur with penetrating trauma or forceful vomiting
    - Signs: chest pain, fever, crepitus, mediastinitis
    - Diagnosis: contrast esophagography or endoscopy
    - Management: surgical repair + antibiotics
11. **Diaphragmatic Rupture**
    - Usually left-sided; abdominal organs herniate into thorax
    - Signs: bowel sounds in chest, respiratory distress
    - Management: surgical repair via laparotomy/thoracotomy
12. **Pulmonary Contusion**
    - Blunt trauma → alveolar hemorrhage and edema
    - Signs: dyspnea, hypoxia, patchy infiltrates on CXR
    - Management: oxygen, fluid restriction, ventilation if severe
