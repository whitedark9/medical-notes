# Open Chest Injury

## Definition

- Penetrating injury to the chest wall causing **communication between pleural space and external environment**
- Can lead to **air entry into pleural space** (pneumothorax), haemothorax, or both
- Common causes: stab wounds, gunshot wounds, impalement

## Immediate / Emergency Management

### 1. Primary Survey – ATLS Approach

- **Airway**: Ensure patency, protect cervical spine if indicated
- **Breathing**: Assess for life-threatening injuries (tension pneumothorax, massive haemothorax)
- **Circulation**: Control external bleeding, establish IV/IO access, begin fluid resuscitation
- **Disability & Exposure**: Rapid neurological assessment and full exposure to identify injuries

### 2. Specific Management

#### A. Occlusive Dressing

- Apply **airtight dressing** over wound immediately
- Tape on **three sides only** (one side untaped to allow air escape) → prevents **tension pneumothorax**

#### B. Oxygen Therapy

- High-flow oxygen to maintain SpO₂ >94%

#### C. Analgesia

- `paracetamol`, `NSAIDs`, or `opioids` for pain control
- Adequate analgesia improves **ventilation and cough**

#### D. Chest Tube Thoracostomy

- Insert **large-bore chest tube** (28–36 Fr) in **5th intercostal space, anterior/mid-axillary line**
- Provides definitive treatment for pneumothorax or haemothorax
- Continuous monitoring of drainage

#### E. Surgical Intervention

- Indications:

  - Ongoing bleeding >200 mL/hour for 2–4 hours
  - Large or complex wounds
  - Associated cardiac, great vessel, or lung injury

- Procedure: **thoracotomy** for bleeding control, repair of lung parenchyma, or diaphragm

### 3. Supportive Care

- Monitor **vital signs**, oxygenation, urine output
- Tetanus prophylaxis
- Antibiotic prophylaxis if penetrating wound
- Early physiotherapy to prevent atelectasis
