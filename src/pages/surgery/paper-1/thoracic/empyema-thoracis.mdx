# Empyema Thoracis

## Definition

- **Empyema thoracis**: Collection of **pus in the pleural space** or infected pleural effusion containing bacteria, fibrin, and inflammatory cells.
- Usually a complication of pneumonia, chest trauma, surgery, or oesophageal rupture.
- Common organisms: _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.

## Diagnosis

### History

- Fever, chills, night sweats
- Pleuritic chest pain
- Cough (may be productive, purulent sputum)
- Dyspnoea
- Recent pneumonia, thoracic surgery, trauma, or tuberculosis

### Physical Examination

- **General**: Fever, malaise, cachexia in chronic cases
- **Respiratory system**:

  - Reduced chest expansion on affected side
  - Dullness to percussion
  - Decreased or absent breath sounds
  - Reduced vocal fremitus
  - Pleural rub (in early stage)

### Investigations

#### For Diagnosis

- **Chest X-ray**: Homogeneous opacity, possible air–fluid level if bronchopleural fistula present
- **Ultrasound chest**: Detects pleural fluid, differentiates between free and loculated fluid, guides aspiration
- **Diagnostic thoracentesis**:

  - Thick, turbid or purulent fluid
  - Gram stain and culture for bacteria
  - Cell count: predominantly neutrophils in acute infection
  - Low glucose, low pH (\<7.2), high protein, high LDH

#### For Causes

- Sputum culture and sensitivity
- Blood cultures
- Tuberculosis workup: AFB smear, GeneXpert, culture

#### For Complications

- Contrast-enhanced CT chest: Detects loculations, pleural thickening, underlying lung pathology (bronchiectasis, abscess, tumor)

## Management

### General Principles

- Eradicate infection
- Drain pleural space
- Restore lung expansion

### 1. Medical Management

- **Empirical intravenous antibiotics** (adjust based on culture):

  - Community-acquired: `ceftriaxone` + `metronidazole` or `clindamycin`
  - Hospital-acquired: `piperacillin-tazobactam` or `meropenem` + MRSA cover (`vancomycin` if suspected)

- Adequate analgesia (`paracetamol`, `NSAIDs`)
- Oxygen therapy if hypoxic
- Nutritional support

### 2. Drainage

- **Intercostal drainage tube (ICD)** insertion under water seal drainage
- Ultrasound-guided placement if loculated collections
- Fibrinolytic agents (e.g., intrapleural `streptokinase` or `tPA + DNase`) for septated empyema if surgery is not immediately possible

### 3. Surgical Management

- **Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)**: For loculated empyema or failure of tube drainage
- **Open thoracotomy with decortication**: In chronic, organized empyema with thick pleural peel preventing lung expansion

### 4. Management Of Underlying Cause

- Antitubercular therapy if TB empyema
- Treat pneumonia, abscess, or trauma source

| Step        | Management                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Antibiotics | Broad spectrum → culture-guided              |
| Drainage    | ICD, USG-guided, fibrinolytics               |
| Surgery     | VATS, open decortication if failed drainage  |
| Supportive  | Oxygen, analgesia, nutrition                 |
| Cause       | Specific treatment for TB, pneumonia, trauma |
