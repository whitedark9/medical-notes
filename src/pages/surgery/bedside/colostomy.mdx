# Colostomy

> A colostomy is a planned opening made in the colon to divert faeces and flatus through the abdominal wall, where they can be collected in an external appliance.

## Types of Colostomy

### 1. Based on Duration

| Type          | Description                                                     | Indications                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temporary** | Created to divert fecal flow for a limited time; later reversed | - Bowel obstruction <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Anastomotic protection (e.g., after low anterior resection)                                                   |
| **Permanent** | Created when fecal diversion is lifelong                        | - Inoperable colorectal cancer <br/> - Fecal incontinence <br/> - Total proctocolectomy (e.g., for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis) |

### 2. Based on Location

| Type                     | Location                            | Output Characteristics      | Indications                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cecostomy**            | Cecum (right lower quadrant)        | Liquid stool                | - Fecal incontinence in children (antegrade continence enema) <br/> - Colonic decompression in obstruction |
| **Ascending colostomy**  | Ascending colon (right side)        | Liquid to semi-liquid stool | - Right-sided colonic obstruction <br/> - Trauma                                                           |
| **Transverse colostomy** | Transverse colon (mid-abdomen)      | Semi-formed stool           | - Temporary fecal diversion (loop colostomy) <br/> - Colorectal cancer                                     |
| **Descending colostomy** | Descending colon (left side)        | Formed stool                | - Permanent fecal diversion (e.g., for left-sided colorectal cancer)                                       |
| **Sigmoid colostomy**    | Sigmoid colon (left lower quadrant) | Well-formed stool           | - Most common permanent colostomy <br/> - Diverticular disease <br/> - Rectal cancer                       |

### 3. Based on Surgical Technique

| Type                        | Description                                                                                                | Indications                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **End colostomy**           | One end of the colon is brought out as a stoma; the distal bowel is either removed or closed               | - Permanent fecal diversion (e.g., abdominoperineal resection)    |
| **Loop colostomy**          | A loop of the colon is exteriorized with a protective rod; two openings (proximal = stool, distal = mucus) | - Temporary diversion (e.g., to protect a distal anastomosis)     |
| **Double-barrel colostomy** | Both ends of the transected colon are brought out as separate stomas                                       | - When temporary diversion is needed but reanastomosis is planned |

## Complications of Colostomy

### 1. Early Complications (Within 30 Days)

- **Surgical complications**: Bleeding, infection, anastomotic leakage
- **Stoma-related**: Ischemia/necrosis, mucocutaneous separation, retraction
- **Mechanical**: Parastomal hematoma, ileus, obstruction
- **Other**: Electrolyte imbalance (more common in ileostomy)

### 2. Late Complications (>30 Days)

- **Stoma-related**: Prolapse, retraction, stenosis
- **Hernia**: Parastomal hernia
- **Skin issues**: Dermatitis, ulceration
- **Functional**: High-output stoma, diarrhea, constipation

## Colostomy Closure or Colostomy Reversal

> Surgical procedure to restore bowel continuity after a temporary colostomy.

<details>
<summary>Indications for Closure</summary>

- Resolution of the primary condition (e.g., anastomotic healing after low anterior resection).
- Good general condition of the patient.
- No evidence of distal obstruction or disease recurrence.

</details>

 <details>
 <summary>Contraindications</summary>

- Poor nutritional status.
- Ongoing pelvic sepsis or anastomotic complications.
- Short bowel syndrome or inadequate distal bowel length.

 </details>

### Preoperative Evaluation

1. **Clinical Assessment**
   - General health, nutritional status.
   - Absence of peristomal skin complications or hernia.
2. **Imaging & Investigations**
   - **Contrast enema or colonoscopy** → To check for strictures, obstruction, anastomotic integrity.
   - **CT scan (if needed)** → To rule out intra-abdominal pathology.
   - **Blood tests** → Hemoglobin, albumin, and electrolytes for surgical fitness.

### Surgical Techniques

1. Extra-peritoneal closure technique
1. Intra-peritoneal closure technique

| Technique                               | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct closure**                      | Ends of the stoma are mobilized and anastomosed primarily.                      |
| **Re-anastomosis**                      | If the distal colon is intact, a hand-sewn or stapled anastomosis is performed. |
| **Laparotomy or Laparoscopic Approach** | May be required in difficult cases (e.g., adhesions, distorted anatomy).        |
